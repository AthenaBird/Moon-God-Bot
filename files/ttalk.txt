yo wtf this some 1984 shit
<:monkaS:442185930867081218>
BIG BIRB IS ALWAYS WATCHING
irene is a bitch
<a:birbdance:614609682446680066>

alright everyone proceed with your normal conversations, jsut know the thought police wil come get you
<:omaewa:442183539341918209>
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
yum
delicious
mmm
<:yourdeath:713653810211586141>
poor jasons gonna have to regex all these emotes out later
However if your minds are thotty then the thot police with cum get you
not the thot police
imagine using regex and not manually deleting
loli
oh no
<:shook:606018427018149889>
<a:ieatass:577482949130321941>
here they come
how does it handle embeds
noice
not gonna lie i have no idea
does it note commands that r deleted
i didnt even put in a try-catch block
yes
this will be broken before it gets anything cool
it catches anything that is instantly sent
shiiii
cant even hide
<:uwudaddy:606017963308613636>
you can
because we dont document who sent it
just that it was
so in theory it could just be 1 person talking to themselves and big birb will never know
got it
i think we need to become dictators again with this shit
alright everyone start popping off
Discord chatterbot
pop off
wait i wonder if they already have that
Ben drowned
**crickets**
<@!186322067111542784> and i are anxious to start making a bot that can just pretend to be u guys
**crickets**
can't you just steal the chatterbot code?
i mean take inspiration from
well this one wont converse with u
itll just steal ur words
its like autocorrect
er
THOT thievery
autocomplete
auto discord
we wont even need ttalk
just have bots talk in a seperate channel
call it
LOL
ttalk 2.0
Bot talk
finally a place where i can speak freely
the goal is
to have a bot that will just
shit out sentences
<a:thonkRotate:585659541329412106> if two bots dm each other ... we will never see that conversation
my smol brain cannot comprehend majority of this conversation
so this is how the robot invasion starts huh
can it also barf out sentences?
i've stopped trying to read
automation 100
okay sdimple speak, bot reads bot speakes
oh fuck maybe im too smol brain for this conversation too
hopefully i can gather enough data but not too much to break the entire server it runs on lol
just wait till 3am
thats when the bot will break
i sure hope not

I am not a weeb <:ucsd:441455775899189248>
i almost appled into neuro <:wsVsU7mxSU2FdfU5NtpgQA_thumb_470:688600982212706336>
oh nice
Well APPLY FOR A MAJOR CHANGE
*only if you want to and have given it deep consideration beforehand*
neuro is pretty interesting i'll give you that i just haven't decided what i want to speciailize in ig  ???????
<:thonk:440231969796784128>
I heard neuro
Evening
That's perfectly fine and you have a lot of time ahead to explore what the biological sciences have to offer you.
yupyupyup
> cog sci
ü§î
*ill take it*
<:thonk:440231969796784128>
dw brochacho i'll come straight to you if i do decide on neuro xD
<:thowonking:712569034209493042>
I'd be in Bio but I couldn't take those general courses
I feel like both neurobiology and psychology kiddos shit on cog sci
Way too much of just learning what I already got taught
Cogs shits back on psych
But we can't do much
'cause experimental psychology
And behavioural neuroscience
I'm more of a do everything kinda guy
when psychology finally starts becoming more recognized as doing hard science things <:thinkies:713308987843674153>
But its actually just evolved into a different field
my dad shits on psych <:FeelsStrongManW:650822412287475744>
Which is exactly what UCSD cogs did
> my dad shits on psych :FeelsStrongManW:
<@!652073170890915864> :reeeeeeee:
<:reeeeeeee:694835050189160509>
clinical psychology is getting much more neurosciencey nowadays too
Cogs evolved into data science/design
The OG CSE/philosophy/ethnographic stuff is kinda dead
> <@!652073170890915864> :reeeeeeee:
<@!245736329382461440> Expected of my father bruh
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
this is not a Surpise
It's interesting to see how much the discipline is evolving.
I'm in Cogs because I can't ever pick one thing to do
It might change again, we recently got a new head of the department
And Don Norman leaves in July
Forever
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
What if there was a clinical neuropsychology class <:scrunchthink:440232169919610880>
So we can kiss our money goodbye
i mean major
Not more majors
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
You can petition for a new major btw
Theres already like 10 different neuro-esque majors
what are they
Well theres neuro
I know of cog sci neuro specialization
Cogs specialism
Psych has one I believe
And Cogs Psych is evolving into it
technically theres old majors too like physio and neuro but that doesnt count tbh
Bio has a focus
Theres possibly more coming too
There's no neuro psych major yet
Its coming
I need to read up on this if there's a place
A part of the issue is all the departments wanting a piece of the pies
Because they think they 'own' the major
Like Maths vs Jacobs over CSE
There's already the joint cognitive and behavioral neuroscience major
> maths
<:monkaHmm:516388020895612961>
Our CSE started in maths
And Natural Sciences
Hence why its not a *traditional* CS major
There were big faculty fights back in the day
I had one of said faculty teach me last year
That's the thing with interdisciplinary such-and-things
Its starting with cogs now too
We've got fights over HCI/Data Science
And even Design
"and even design" lmao
(Do we, or do we not have a Design major?)
yes
But then the problem with a Design major
I heard of it sometime
Is it won't be what people think it is
*Design* in the Design Lab sense
Is everything from architecture, to data science
What happened to the ol' classic fashion design?
Hell my group alone has a bio, cogs, and CSE professor
Design is everything

CogSci/Math
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
What the fuck
I like it
Whoever you are
Yes
Is that a double major I see?
Jim Hollan is gonna like you
Or is that a specialization
Double Major
I think it's too late for me to reconsider a clinical psychology major.
That or a double in Data Science is the ultimate HCI move
Which is where the big data science / cocks money is nowadays
Algorithms
Hello friends
<:monkaGIGA:585569750281748481>
I wish people were more interested in neuroscience so I can talk with them about it and share our passions <:pepehands:464568955533524992>

<@!213151486434082817> now u have to tell us

Sleep paralysis is scary because I have no idea what's going on
thank god ive never had sleep paralysis
sounds scary as all hell
I had it like _once_
And it was freaky
it IS
i've had it three times
never again pls
sleep paralysis was a very interesting  experience
it's freaky once you start hearing stuff
what's it like
oh it just made me realize C&BT is not really my thing, but the girl was hot enough that I kidna sat through it, but I was not enjoying my time
i don't think i've ever experienced

poor bby
Shit hurted
lmao
im kinda scared to ask wat c$bt r
<:
so please no stomping
o
OH

oh god
bru
i left it as an acronym to not trigger anyone
or mashing
or or or
randy said search at ur own risk
i think a slight step is permissible
uh oh
wait no
but the amt of pressure
i forgot to mention it was 2 people one enjoying themselves, and one doing the deed
is impt
bc you don't wna do permanent dmg
It hurts to have a rider sometimes, especially when they skinny
You seem to have a lot of knowledge about this
im scared to join this convo
<:nyello:441469558423814144>

<:FeelsStrongManW:650822412287475744>
almost like bones r super hard
mmmm
yes
those r the best kind
they do be hard most of the time
<:yeet:442868651792793601>
horny on main
no just anatomical
are bones supposed to be soft <:hyperJ:694448211439648809>
we're tlaking about the density of bones
excuse me
lets be honest this isn't main
imagine having bones tht can shift phases
imagine having bones
<:AnimeInsane:615441328720838656>
sorry bone goes from solid to slightly less solid
imagine
not liquid
become amorphous jelly<:stonks:713344926418731018>
if it turns to liquid you have a problem
might wanna get that checked out homie
this reminds me of that one family guy ep
if it turns to gas, well good luck
bye bye bone marrow <:zoop:435223493311725573>
but yeah CBT is a thing, i don't understand the enjoyment but to each their own
kekekekee

OH
I JUST REALIZED WHAT CBT MEANT
i feel like people that are into it are sorta masochistic?
<:Cryga:576487215102689290>
is that the term or is sadistic?
cognitive behavioral therapy is gr8
nope had it rihgt to start
sadism = named after this french d00d named sade
like the more pain the better for them
but idk
who wrote rlly fked up sexual narratives centered around pain
No pain no gain
oh no
- my math teacher
egh
sadism = dishes out pain, enjoys it
yee yee
i just read up on it again
we love light reading before bed
now what about slight choking kekekeke
sorry we could move to another disc
ofc tiktok is the thing that makes the 24 talk
also randy wat kinda books do u read
books?
Psychological domination anyone?
i odn't read unless forced
no no no, thats manipulation
> ofc tiktok is the thing that makes the 24 talk
<@!345083648124649485> tiktok izz fun
it izz what it izz
LOL
F am i too zoomer
shhh its ok if it works it works
> now what about slight choking kekekeke
<@!213151486434082817> if ur not doing it hard ur not doing it right
tiktok is okay
i get my tiktok content from twitter and ig i can't lie
secondhand tiktok
JK JFKSHFJKHSFJS BAD ADVICE
squeeze from sides, don't press down
oh i already learned that lesson
ekekeke
> i get my tiktok content from twitter and ig i can't lie
<@!245736329382461440> tiktok funni
the hard way or
little bit of both
there can still be too much pressure, but yes only from the sides
idk each person is different too
speaking of not knocking anyone out by c-wording them too much, i'm gna ktfo soon
tru
communicate with ur partners n all tht jazz
learn how to read peoples bodies, it suprisingly works in every day situations as well
> communicate with ur partners n all tht jazz
<@!286708165612011531> yes yes yes, idk how much times i need to give this advice to couples
even friends in general
funny how college ppl don't understand tht boundaries r a thing
i mean being able to communicate is always where its at
Communication is hard.
it isn't once you get comfortable with telling people how you feel
you should never hold that back
causes problems
that can be avoided
which i get is hard sometimes if ur not used to asking for wht u want
People don't want me to tell them how I feel :/
trust me, I know this from experience
I do recall me being straight forward but yeah 90% of people online are too scared especially if they've met someone in person
I mean there is a certain aspect of telling people how you feel, starting out with peole and telling them your entire life story can be hard
they're scared of what happens next
but as long as you're an aduly
adult
and handle it like one
and don't word it poorly
you should be good
Wording can make or break the feel of a sentence
and dont be afraid to call someone
because text is hard
^^
tone is better when talked not texted
If you're really unsure of both text and call, sometimes taking the time to step back think and write about it always helps
> People don't want me to tell them how I feel :/
<@!252670263848599563> this is rlly disheartening to hear
i love using "i feel" statements bc it doesn't point fingers at the other party, and i avoid starting disagreements with "you did xyz"
ppl get defensive quite easily
i'll move this to srs bc it's gna be long and then im gna head to bed
sleep is for the week!
> i love using "i feel" statements bc it doesn't point fingers at the other party, and i avoid starting disagreements with "you did xyz"
<@!286708165612011531> agreed and i think a lot of ppl mistakenly use "you did xyz"
so yes get some sleep so you can power through the week
oh lordy, its already midnight
ummmmm acahgtaually its 20 minutes past midnight
lol
how is the writing going jenny
terribly XD
but its fine, i'll finish before deadline for sure

<:pepepoog:606017447623131166>
End goal for me would prob be astronaut tho
I want to be the first asian on mars
Well maybe not mars specifically
But you get the point
But unfortunately space is a very competitive field
So im ok with not accomplishing that
But its more of like a dream rather than a realistic goal for me rn lmao
Maybe some day tho
Yoo
Where did everyone go
Twas poppin just a second ago
class
Ahh
Damn everyone has class at the same time?
12pm class hits different
I mean i guess my classes are all morning
But i never go to them
Yea i have a class in 30 min lmao
I dont want to go to class tho im still in bed and naked
for me its the sudden realization that this week is kinda important
where its my last chance to determine whether or not i am p/np or full send all letter grades
Oh fuuck
aka starting on work assigned 4 weeks ago
I felt that tho
i think i need to change one class to p/np
> ||I dont want to go to class tho im still in bed and naked||
<@!219584106550263809> just to let you know, this is tmi

tbh it was tmi in general
^^
cuz lost in translation

Ok
Hows rhis
I dont want to go to class bc im still in bed and not dressed
better
but maybe just say you're still in your pfs
pjs*
nothing would be left to interpretation
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
Oki doki then
Under our clothes
We are all naked
heresy
What I said was true, from a certain point of view
true, but not needed
ur  skin  covers ur bones üôÇ
bold of you to assume i have a physical corporeal form
To be fair the convos get p weird in here
is it possible to have a spiritual corporeal form
im going to bath and body works for a new vessel anyone need anything
Like andrews
I‚Äôm still in bed and tired
Siamese twins
i'd like a new back
hi still in bed and tired
grow one diana
just cut ur old one off
I woke up at 5am to watch a stray kids mv and then went back to sleep
bath and body works <:PatrickGasm:600914637940326400>
it'll grow back soon!
Nick
oooooo
I need a body that works
maybe that's why i havent grown taller
damn, same wilson
Still in bed gang
i wish i was still in bed üò≠
<@!405810391025713156> i dont remember anyone asking but thanks
tru u just need to keep cutting off parts of ur  body until they regrow to to what u like
y'all ever wake up from a dream/nightmare and just feel hella exhausted?
Yea
Thats called life
like i just used all my brain power to dream that shit up instead of resting
Still waiting to wake up
I have a midterm to study for but I am tired
And a paper to do
when i get out of having a dream and i spend brain power wondering how i could think up those random faces/monsters i see
Only got 300 words done <:kek:490008924414803968>
what's it on?
the essays this week are wackkk
A jazz artist
Ugh I have to write an essay in a class I don't even remember the content of
i have to present an article today and i havent found an article to present yet
.
imagine having a synthesis essay about 5 authors being put into 2 pages
that sounds like hell
ouch
essays sound bad
ah
thankfull no warren writing or phil for me these past two  quarters ü•∞
its going to be interesting
it's bliss to not have wcwp
when you misclick the friend request button and make someone sad :(
i mean its more like an opinion piece but using ideas that we learned in the class
and "bringing in fresh ideas"
heres a fresh idea
> I woke up at 5am to watch a stray kids mv and then went back to sleep
<@405810391025713156> an actual mood
Imagine being in warren
Wait
imagine being
tfw there's a vlive at 3am
tfw im only in hum 2 and dying and theres 5 hums üôÉ
imagine
i still have yet to do hum 5 lmao
I don‚Äôt even watch vlives anymore because they all happen at 5am
<:PEPESCREAM:466446495747670027>
im becoming a senior
wtf
have you done one at a CC, randy?
nope
ok old man<@213151486434082817>
maybe take hum 5 at cc?
if they offer
my back hurts lmao
Dw Jenny it gets better
i heard hum at a CC is the strat
my arm hurts
yeah but we're only allowed to take 1, nick
Like mmw 14 and 15 were much easier than first three
transfer to warren jenny üôÇ
i mean i can but i don't see a point when the class is paid for anyways
<:kek:490008924414803968>
No
hum at cc is 100% the strat
Transfer to Marshall
i did hum 4 at cc
Best college
easy, fun, chill, prof cared, history class that i learned a lot about
noted, richard
Sixth is best college excuse me
yessirrr
Im just too lazy to do the readings
this chatroom is an engine of anxiety lol
Hum classes being history related <:feelsweirdman:562445754224869376>
randy imagine doing hum readings
:^)
you gotta learn to read fast or eat ass patrick
We‚Äôre all anxious human beings
i mean skimming the readings better than not doing them at all
i mean some readings were cool but some of them
i just sparknoted bc
didnt want t do it
like francis bacon was so ?????
ive increased my typing speed purely from this server
Imagine reading the readings assigned to you
why not both, dino
Eating ass <:PatrickGasm:600914637940326400>
the more the merrier
Hum 5 is better because its more psychological than historical
wait jenny
sorta related but sorta not
tbh i feel like the speed which we type is a deterent for new ppl sometimes
can u ride a skateboard
I don‚Äôt even type that fast
the chat goes 0-100 rlly fucking fst
fast
sometimes
I can‚Äôt type at all
or theres multiple conversations
i mean its like were trying to have a normal conversation but with 20 people
but maybe that sjsut the way it is
ü¶ß
and theres like 5 different conversations going on at once
<@!87652481768620032> no but i wanna learn
all about weird topics
Like rn
why?
how tf was that related at all lmao
see like jenny and nick are having a conversation
Nick
while were having a conversation
yEEt
diana  said skate fast or eat ass

Tbh I feel that
I want to roam campus at 2am again
Sit on top of buildings
ive only gone up the revelle roof during day time i feel like i should go up there at night some time
keeling roof*
jump off said building
san diego has so much potential for cool places and i cant wait to bring my car
but its prob crowded bc ik my suitemates went up there with some other people to smoke or something
like theres def so many scenic spots no one rlly goes to
yea ppl did that at keeling over ss2 last year
argo roof is accessible too
did anyone drop shit from there this year
bc last year my friends dropped a pumpkin
and hydroflasks
welcome <@!273916092294889473> !!!
to see if the flask would break
ah i heard fall quarter people were cheating on cse21 on argo roof
sun go dieded so we are manually verifying
Welcome!
wait what LOL
like 20-30 of them were just doing their PAs up there lmao
there's pa's in 20/21?
i thought it was math ...
wow welcome!
bro ....
Welcome!! <@!273916092294889473> <:banzai:442185100273123328>

thank you guys
nah it was mbmb
shouldve assumed
sorry
another revelle man
NO its MY fault
IM sorry
NO ITS MINE
NO ITS MINE
gdi jenny
NOOO
IM sorry
im sorryER
11 wasn't that hard...
<:kirbygun:613942917135990803> let me say sorry, bitch
welcome!
ikr, Luke
we can both be equally sorry :)
i was like
why you gotta cheat on 11
imagine cheating
my friend got AI'd in 11 bc he let this girl copy this PA
yikes
ok tbf i copied off stackexchange for one q on cse 11 pa2
i think
but i didnt like
copy the whole thing
and then
i didnt get off the waitlist
anyways
F
ai tbh
F
is something kinda hard to obtain
honestly
like unless you're copying word for word 80% of thetime
im fucking appalled that no one got ai'd for sio15
people literally copied word for word
on the hw's
at that point you deserved to get aied
like if ur gonna cheat be smart about it
^^
this is not condoning cheating
<:think:613867581522313231>
but theres so much undetected cheating esp on copying hw
well if you're smart, you shouldnt be cheating in the first place
<:think:613867581522313231>
i have no idea how no one got caught in cogs 18
considering
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
someone posted the "exam" jupyter notebook
onto chegg
well
school smarts < street smarts
for someone else to write their code
yea what luke said
99 wouldnt understand
üôÉ
:^)
nhu .
integrity doesnt exist in the real world cheat ur heart out
that's ok, i dont understand a lot of things
lmao
nhu here
to spit facts
well that‚Äôs a rather drab way to look at the world nhu
the real world is dog eat dog, eat or be eaten üò†
By that same logic people are shitty so we shouldn‚Äôt have morals
does anyone else nut for excel sheets
slurp or be _slorp_
people are very shitty
can confirm
this is philosophy time
jk wrong time
i have no faith in humanity or people
doesn‚Äôt mean you have to be shitty too üôÇ
yes, dino
disregard me pls
excel sheets <:PatrickGasm:600914637940326400>
i shall catch up
yessss Dino
Lol
Excel sheets
With COLORS
I use excel to plan my classes
And FORMULAS
COLORED EXCEL SHEETS?!?!?!??! <:PatrickGasm:600914637940326400>
excel sheetsssss
fuccckkk
real world is actually haha life go brr
The colors are so pretty
esp when all of your equations line up perfectly
organization <:PatrickGasm:600914637940326400>
oooo
yah but i dont think "cheating" is shitty
i dunno i think the entire schooling system (esp at big schools where exams determine 80% of ur grade) is deeply flawed
and using ur resources to best apply urself to courses and subjects that u will never have to know by heart isn't smth that is that bad
i mean this qtr is a good example of that
i think copying an exam is ba
bc u learn nothing
bad
but its pretty obvious a lot of people zoom call
during midterms
this quarter
AI is one of those gray area
and i think that if people are working together through it, they demonstrate an understanding of the knowledge and find a workaround to this rlly fucked up quarter
so its kinda
fine
imo
^
bc end of the day ur paying a fuckton for school
and plus teamwork is a huge part of
so its ur prerogative to actually learn
so
"real world" careers
like in the real world im never gonna be shut in a room with a proctor who asks me to calculate the momentum of a spring tied to a pully or some shit
like id ... be able to google or ask people
like i havent cheated during exams but i can empathize w ppl who have
u'd never ever be penalized for collaborating w colleagues either
nah
if u ask ur colleague
what the time is
instantly fired
LOL
no reference for ur next job
the ceo personally decapitates u
blacklisted for life
yup
richard go to
penguin
ok
club penguin online which server üëÄ üëÄ üëÄ
jk
Didn't CPO get shut down
ive never played cpo
sun god is temp down
more glitch problems D:
i just think the pfp is a funny meme
:(
F
Why is everyone green now
bc in order to beat ucds
ucsd
u have to leave ucsd first
when u gap quarter the nhu shit green council will consider ur eligibility
can you guys waitlist for classes?
you can't waitlist on first pass
second pass you can
but you can waitlist ss tho <:AnimeInsane:615441328720838656>
ah
this is what happens when i have priority for two years

F
oh you only have priority for two years?
yeah
I had that
with the First Gen Success Coaching Program
ah i see
I miss prio enrollment <:PepeHands:504520804466163732>
is anyone in math 180a this quarter
does anyone know if
ur discussion
matters
cuz
when i had it di didnt matter
do u learn anything useful in di?
bc rmp says au goes hella fast / isnt gr8
highkey not rlly
ok bet

wait
wheres matt
dead
trying to do hw
asleep
i feel uncomfortble bc its been too quiet
its getting closer to finals
makes sense
oh ok
y'all ever just write in bursts?
like i'll write 2 pages in 30 mins then not do anything productive for like an hr
ME
holy crud
writing my essays its 2 paragraphs of good things then i go awol for like 4 hours and then return
I have a question
With the VAC, does each question have to be a different submission?
i dont think so
i mean if its like completely different questions like one on your major and another question on like a different topic
then yes
put your finger down if your code doesnt work because you used a variable called nu instead of the variable ni and you spent more than 6 hours wondering what was wrong to the point that you went to all of the office hours for both your TA and professor and they couldnt tell you what was wrong and you figure it out when you finally decide to just rewrite the entire thing over again
it's me
im bitches
<:pepehands:464568955533524992>
my friend did the same thing for our last pa D:
she rewrote it 3 times before she figured out that she didnt loop back
i felt that
i still have another problem to debug
reeeeeeeee
fuck
D:
that hurts to read
the amount of spelling errors i made
coding for me is like reading
yes
tr
i wont understand it the first or second time
tru
if i stare at one thing for too long it all blurs
i can relate
and it takes hours for me to understand a single passage
this is why i haven't started on my project yet
D:
uh oh
coding hard
it's due friday of finals week so watch me do it the last minute <:kek:490008924414803968>
lmao
thats me with doc rn
how's doc 3
i havent started on my research project yet
planning on getting drunk sometime and slapping my keyboard until something comes out
big brain
i do that except the drunkenness
<:kek:490008924414803968>
my essay makes 0 sense but i need to finish the motivation to just type whatever
like i keep hesitating bc im like damn i wanna make this better but its not getting any better and i really just need to get it done
try speedrunning it
time urself and go for a pb lmao
i bs my doc 3 paper last year
and somehow ended up with an A- in the class
yeah
ooo
i dont think effort scales with grade in doc
yeah i keep setting myself deadlines with time
and its not going well XD
i was like ah imma finish this by 8
oh no
i only have 3/5 pages written
*oh no*
<:PEPESCREAM:466446495747670027>
i have an essay due thursday
only have 300 words down
i have 800 words atm D:
it's due thursday morning too
but the assignment says midnight
i've been baited
<:kek:490008924414803968>
i was gonna work on it after my midterm
"was gonna"
<:pepehands:464568955533524992>
i should probably start my research project now
yes
brb gonna get some alc
o
you know I think coding is a lot like poetry
and nobody likes poetry
*blinks in emily dickinson*
*and walt whitman*
*and ocean vuong*
aight time to start drinking and doing doc
charles ur a phat mood idk how u write drunk tho
tht's a feat
<@!286708165612011531> nows probably a good time to learn that vietnamese
someone once said write drunk, edit sober and i mean. can't disagree
it works
before u drink go "mot hai ba do!" tht's drunk viet 101 for ya
LMAO
<@!219584106550263809> didnt know you referred to yourself as nobody
üòâ
jokes aside i was our city's poet laureate
it kinda sucks how schools shove poetry down ppls throats
I meean
and it becomes unenjoyable
You mean fulton
hi! how is everyone
to the point where it soils the beauty in a lot of other poetry
hi lisette !
and yeah
@@@@@ fulton
altho i learned a lot from that project
Makes 15 yr olds question reality
one of my favorite lines from a poem
is "i'd rather learn from one bird how to sing
than teach ten thousand stars how not to dance"
Well yea
Bc what do you get from that
At least wit the bird you now know how to sing
just caught up in chores wbu lisette
> jokes aside i was our city's teen* poet laureate
<@!433774411682938890> this is rlly dope irene

It was a joke calm down
Ofc ppl like poetry

It was a quote LMAO
<@!219584106550263809> yeah sorry i was trying to play off it too but i failed massively
idk how long but i think there‚Äôs a way to check
search your tab
in the search function
and date it by olders
oldest
don't we have a bot
*profile
yes but that requires going to the bot channel
and remembering
idfk the prefix
the commands
yea i just know the command is whois

Lmao in one of my essays i started with ‚ÄúAccording to great american poet Tupac Shakur‚Äù
AHAHAHA
Fulton did not like that one
rip tupac

randy wht's wrong with a men loving men scheme
jkjk
women >>>>>>>
is that what mlm is
<:thonk:440231969796784128>
bro i got a mlm scheme in my MAIL when my mom got the mail
from mfing vector
yes and multi lvl marketing <@!314229461396488195>
o
it's like a legal get rich quick scheme
i also got a vector letter
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
lowkey debating it
you sell knives
noooo dont do it
oo be careful dino
more struggle than it‚Äôs worth
it's not worth
i jk
our minds
but the idea is tempting
to do "nothing" and make money
MLM is so fun to fuck with
i mean the people
lmaoooo
also its multi level marketing
I remember one time this guy from hawaii contacted me in a shop, and sold me his pitch
then he contacted me later for a "interview" and sent the typical buzz words
i need someone to do me a favor
then he sent me the book
like a really big favor
that his "0ompany" uses
trying to find the person in here who did my psych100 exam for me 2 years ago. i miss them.
?? wilson??
ok so basically you know how everyone kinda had that "ho" and "party" phase their freshman year
well i never got that
and im gonna turn 20 soon
that what
what ho and party phase?
im wholesome
^
I didn‚Äôt ?
so i need someone to take me to a bunch of parties so i can bury my late teens
i h8 ppl who say they're wholesome
and let me have that phase
so i can move on
ninob? did you have a party phase?
i was dd and sober buddy all of last yr
see
nice
didn't start drinking until thxgiving 2019
she was a good student kekeke
Me but Christmas 2019
Nina
I didn't have a party phase but i enjoyed the occasional drink with my frinedos
randy was a former pbro i do not trust his defn of w(ho)l(e)some
hey hey hey, i was the most wholesome of them all
im my sororities sober sister
i'm wholesome, Ninob üôÇ
one of my pbro's was having a thing with one of the guy's girls
now i don't trust the guy
lmao fr tho
i just want to get invited to stuff
like i was finally talking to ppl
and going ojut
and the COVID hit
and im like well guess it just wasnt meant to be
like that it do be
but yea like fuck covid
just found out it was a guy named edward
is he still here
there's a lot of edwards
^
<@!206933072078307328> <@!265022881358938113> <@!645091073839857684> <@!120396270299906049>
Uhh
you're gonna have to be more sepcifieccf
wilson wtf
well cast a wider net right?
so if its one of them
lmao you didnt have to ping them
theyll come on
oh i thought that was the point
^what dino said
you gotta narrow it down first
dont ping unless you know who you're pinging
the thought counts
i meaaan theres only 4 edwards here
theyll pull through
i have faith
i know which one
the music one
nice!

See that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs good to wait
Now you could‚Äôve just pinged 1
tbh i always felt like it's a waiting game with invites to functions
he literally got me a 98 on my final in 2018. thanks edward. thinking of u rn.
<@!151123898698563584> teach me the ways of the ho pls
and take me to raves
he's a ha
wut
hes the most ho here tho
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
it‚Äôll be weird. cause ucsd isn‚Äôt a party school right
he's retired
teach me your ways jeff
yes
hes retired
UCSD students are not UCSD itself
so he has lots of wisdom
omg...
yikes
i go to a PARTY PARTY school atm
which one
Chico?
our mascot is a beer keg
LOL
I'm glad I was able to help in a time of crisis and shit internet
OH wait i remember now???
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
she asked if someone could login
and take her test
wait a sec
is that ai
<:monkaS:442185930867081218>
cause her internet destructed
my internet literally died
and i couldn‚Äôt take it on my iphone 5c cause that‚Äôs what i had until a few months ago
YOU HAD A WHAT
but yea i wanna bury my teens
ah i see
UNTIL 2019
o
an iphone 5c
A WHAT
<:bigyeet:713268953564315699>
<:YOUWHAT:714649912410898514>
it still functioned, there was no need to upgrade in my book
BABY GIRL HOW'D YOU SURVIVE
1. you join a social org that's not dry. for example vsa. not saying tht we throw functions! we just. throw social events. and then things happen when you get to know ppl and you'll get invites tht way, esp when you join our house system
2. you join a frat. pretty obvious
3. uhhhhhh lots of friends who are in those orgs. but frat parties are virtually impossible for guys to get into if ur not rushing so *:
<@!219584106550263809>  don't be discouraged by covid, a lot of ppl can't go to functions bc of it, not just you
functioning but apple stopped updating it
<:bigyeet:713268953564315699>
yeah. i got an 11 in january
<:shook:606018427018149889>
damn
from 4 inches to 6.1
yea but like hella ppl already have friends there
i'll take it
so its like easier
i was just starting out before the quarantine
and now that fall is online too
you really just have to be open to putting urself out there
i feel like i may never get that chance
im just pissed
idk how to put myself out there rn
understandable, getting a headstart in socializing is imperative to having a p solid friend grp, esp in ur first yr but like
<:thonk:440231969796784128> im very aware of vsa having a coalition formed in some way, they aint stopping me from integrating right in
<a:aniEvilPlan:657098437040537600>
ucsd asce and other orgs are still holding zoom events
and if ur gna be at ucsd in the fall, hopefully there will be on campus events?
hOPEFulliy
<:shook:606018427018149889>
i literally bailed on all of MASA's zoom events
Not any big ones
^
But there will be some small ones

<@!286708165612011531> are you jealous of my viet coffee
not quite, since it's from a boba shop
i kid, 7leaves house coffee is p gud but i do prefer making it on my own
v therapeutic
if not fresh i love using instant viet coffee packets from vn bc tht shit still hits hard
is it really viet coffee if it's not coming from the dripping thing
<a:hahakek:676470025317777484>
THE DRIPPING THING SFKJSJKFHSJDFHDS
i love the dripping thing
lmao i dont know what it's called
LOL
the french press ig
o
that sounds like a french newspaper
but it's just a coffee press
*Le Press de Francais*
yeah all my life i knew viet coffee as that drip thingy
french would be like the lil thingie tht u can push down on
same matt
wait
smells really strong and i guess gives you a heart attack if you try to sleep
yes the plunger = french press nvmnvm
have yall had cuban coffee
have yall had cuban coffee
its bomb af
got a little kick to it too
noooo is tht the kind tht u put butter in
uhhh
<:aha:612044524927057921>

you can i guess
and i think columbians put cheese in theirs sometimes which sounds v interesting
would try
OHH yea
ive had that
its hella good
theres another kind where you mix coffee and chocolate
i love coffee drinks but im more of a tea person when it comes too the pure form
i only do coffee in extreme circumstances <:shook:606018427018149889>
last time i went to 7leaves irvine i got the house coffee
and the guy was like how many shots do you want, max is 7
i was like <:monkaS:442185930867081218> <:wuh:440237146998046730>
*seven????*
btw would recommend 3-4
v tasty
but yea i was like holy SHIT sir
They are called 7 leaves <:AnimeInsane:615441328720838656>
t r u e
<:AnimeInsane:615441328720838656>
7 leaves more like 7 shots
<a:monkaShoot:699841146943176734>
guy was like pew pew pew
with your coffee
then stoof became
<a:monkaRun:713632928290046012>
i think i got 3
last time
and then i decided next time 4 was good
go for 5 next
o i misread
i thought stoof actually got 7 shots
<a:hahakek:676470025317777484>
oh my god
wait nevermind
i doubt they were the same size as coffee shop espresso shots
cuz then 7 shots would be like 75% of the cup
its like the guy who comes to CV and gets 4 shots
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
<a:hahakek:676470025317777484>
5 sometimes
actually reminds me of this guy i knew in hs
idk if he does it everyday
but I see him every saturday
he literally got like 5 shots of espresso after an all nighter
morning
p sure
its not healthy
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>

I'm trying to find an apartment to live in SD for me and my family but
LOL
Everywhere is so damn ugly
In SD
What
sd is ugly
Well La Jolla is orettt
in the city?
Pretty
or the school
i mean i know lot of people who live on base
La Jolla doesn't count
La Jolla is a Jolla
wdym, ario?
Not SD
like actual San Diego
yeah
ok
thats what i thought
?/
wtf is happening
i asked if he was saying ucsd is ugly or just sd in general
he meant the city
ah
ye
ye
<:pepeOK:490384227729408000>
also idk
i dont think it's ugly but
i love SD but you need money to live in a decent place here
i feel like the city is overrated
MUCH better than LA tho
LA is hell
LA is scary
la is hell
La is polluted as fuck
been to la can confirm
i like ucla, but i hate that city
so much
Dont like la
though i love driving there because i can be aggressive
<:aha:612044524927057921>
la noisy
Are you from la?
no
bad for nap
im in orange county
Ooo
south oc
Which city
Ahh
SC
sc?
oc oc oc
but my uncle lives in beverly hills, and i go to LA often
Dude the people in LA are scary
LA is hell to drive in
i only know westminster üôÇ
san clemente i think?
and yeah
oh
pog
correct andrew
ah San Clemente
im right above yall
their newish outlet
ario rlly south south oc
Cool cool
yuh
when he said
i live like 5 minutes away from that outlet
jenny are you genuine on league
south oc
i was like
<:shook:606018427018149889>
irvine?
u can walk there
The only oc city I‚Äôm familiar with is Irvine
yes i am, Matty
Lmao
urf?
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
Because I‚Äôve been there way too many times
san clemente
not irvine
yeah gimme like 5 minutes
ok
brb then
I EHARD OC
HELLO
u heard correctly
hello to u
dont mind ninob shes just trynna start a gan
g
heya im more up north but yessssss
i was born up north if that counts
sacc boys
don't mind andrew he's just spreading false propaganda
ooo oki i was born in fv ehe
santa ana gang
not far away at all from santa ana
like what half an hour drive north?
that aint SHIT
thats far
half and hour not hour and a half randy
idk why people think that
wait lemme see if it's north i lowkey forget which direction it's in
its north
anything within 30-40 minutes is free
yall just dont like driving
ty jenz
üëç
CANT RELATE
its like 45 to an hour from me lol
ario is
at least SC is
30 mins north to me
tfw u gotta drive to north oc for school <:sad_dab:613867302701760542>
from me santa ana is not an hour
it's like half an hour
santa ana is an hr for me
hell santa ana is already like 30 minutes at least
we get it ur from norwalk
maybe 40 mins with traffic
and like 40 to irvine
that aint much imo
i go up there regularly
i think a half hr commute is p good but 40 min is a long drive for me
nah
then again i don't drive often
people from irvine going to santa ana or norwalk lie "Im in the ghetto ratatata"
anything within an hour is ez
jwkfhjkshfjkshfjkdshf irvine/diamond bar ppl r..
sth else
even an hour or two i dont rly care as long as i got the time
^ agree with ario
like driving to UCSD is egh tbh
ok maybe not the 2 hours part
2 is a long time, but ive got friends in the valley cuz i used to live there for a while too and
i see them every so often
not a big deal for me
1.5 hours is like just the right amount of time to be annoying
2 hours is fine though lol
the nina gang gang
<a:monkaShoot:699841146943176734>
i enjoy driving
so it doesnt feel like much
im in the middle so everything is great
traffic is just annoying but whatever
üôÇ
maybe its cause im always driving down alone
30 mins to SD to an hr to santa ana
im right above sd so
ur not close to 626 jenny
or driving up alone
i dont go to LA
fuck LA
driving is fun with you drive a smooth sedan
everything north of me is "far" by most people's standards
<:aha:612044524927057921>
with POWER
but i dont rly care
or a MARO
yessir
i dont even mean la i mean like sgv
ehh like a drive to the beach from me is already 30 minutes
and i don't ever do that
Eww SGV
beach from me is legit like 5 minutes
maybe not even
must be nice
too bad im not much of a beach person
lul
i prefer the mountains
so i hardly ever go üòÇ
imagine living in the snow
couldnt be me
i want to go to the mountains to snowboard too
could DEFINITELY be me
snow goat
or i could learn to surf
snowboarding > surfing
hmmm
anyday of the week
moutains > beach
i never done sufring so i wouldn't know
or just be a lazy piece of shit like me
im in a literal surfer town
yet i never surf
and i go to the beach only every so often
i like it, but it's not my preference you know
yeah i completely understand that
hmm i guess im more of a city person
i like the cities too
but it depends on which ones
i hate LA with a passion
but love places like SF, NY, Tokyo, Berlin
etc
la drivers can burn
^
whole hearted facts
thats the only place where i legitmately hate driving
the place is a cesspool
and the road infrastructure makes no sense
it's literal GARBO
... and then of course, there's the drivers
lul
wait but people in SF are worse at driving
I also hate SD for driving
no fun
ok but do sf roads make no sense
but the roads arent as shitty
roads in LA make no fucking sense
in the downtown
its all one ways
gotta learn how to deal with it
or just never go to LA like me lol
no just that, but it can be really easy to end up on the wrong side of the road
cause like fuck driving in LA
with how they designed them
at night
when u cant see as well
the place is literally dangerous
in la its like u either go diagonal  left or diagonal right and one of them is considered straight???
even people from LA don't like driving in LA
no one likes LA
Tourists love it what do you mean
and dont even get me started about the parking
LUL
tourists dont know shit
they only like it on paper cuz of the media
they dont know what it really is
so they dont count
no local even really cares about LA or anything it has to offer,
no city spirit
lul
<:ppkek:552775140740431875>
SAC GOAT
i mean other than clubs and staples center theres really nothing you need to go into LA for
mhmm
or like if youre going to a convention
and u can find good clubs many other places too
and yeah, conventions too
mmmmm yeah i guess
but that doesnt make LA good
it just has good events cuz it's LA
but like youre not going way out of your way to go to a club
yeah
for sure
Im not even saying LA is good
hello and welcome ario!!
I barely go there unless I have to lol
fellow marshall student :3
yo thank u steph
leave steph
yessir
im kidding i love u
oh..
mg!snap <@!303002872646467596>
_wait_
well
I'd much rather stick to the suburbs and look for cool local things
<a:pepeLaugh:585596844839796736>
imma be living there in the fall
im back bitch
oh welcome back lol
cuz traffic heading into sd from OC
AHAHA
is AIDS
hi back bitch im ur sisters mom
no thank u
oh im well aware
mhmm
imma be real
also yes oc -> sd is terrible
i just chose marshall on my application
cuz the name sounded cool
Its just irvine that makes it shitty
lul
i didnt even look into it
oc to sd rn is actually kinda okay
like you'll be smooth sailing then boom irvine traffic
bc rona killed traffic
but i looked into it afterwards and was releived that it was good
marshall one of the easier colleges
as far as the classes they make u take
^
mhmm
i was glad i didnt pick revelle
sixth best college for easy lowest amount of ge's
after what i read
lmao
hi
üòÇ
hey you did your research congrats lmao
^^ better than me
unlike the rest of us in revelle
i did it after the fact
but got lucky
that mashall was an easier oone
just read the small blurb that they put out and be like oh cool
i just picked it cuz the name was cool, location seemed good, and the building looked cool when i looked it up
thats basically i
Im just glad that i met a good group of people in revelle
but i feel like it's far from tata hall where the bio classes are
so that might be an L
so thats true
who knows what would have happened if i was in a differnt college
wait do marshall transfers have to take doc
but hey, more exercise
also the walk to tata is like 10 min so ur good
i think htey have to take like one class of it?
from marshall
ok not bad
10 minutes revelle to erc if you walk fast enogh
_no one walks that fast_
i've done it
also is parking good if u have a permit?
cuz im gonna have to park my car
nope
at le school
its bad if eeven with a permit
well u see theyre supposedly adding back more parking with the new college
worse now that they ripped up all the parking
however dont know how much its gonna help
since im gonna live at the school, i guess i dont need to drive much
so i can just leave it in whatever spot it is
yeah, its good for when youre off campus
but whenever i do drive finding another spot gonna be annoying i guess
oh well
its hard, because people literally swoop the spot as soon as its open
thats how it's like at community college too
so it's whatever
no i mean even living on campus
people are vultures in those lots, man
at night too
i get you
but oh well
is the parking like in front of the dorm?
or do i have to park in that big parking structure
umm marshal has a structure
OH BET
LET'S GO
but like only the bottom 2 floors have parking i think
imma have to scavenge
roam around like a shark looking for its prey
looking for a spot
yee, some people literally park their car across campus just to get a spot
a lot park at triton ball park but thats literally on the opposite end of campus
that shit be mad lame
i knew a marshall transfer who was taking doc <@!345083648124649485>
i dont want to park outside
my car gonna get messed up that way
yeah i think marshall transfers still have to take at least one or 2
i always keep it garaged, so i dont want all that heat
and crap
ew
24/7
and idk what doc is
writing course
but i'll take whatever i have to
ah
that aint a problem
writing is ez
...
oh hunny
literally never had a problem with any course outside of STEM
compared to STEM classes, i dont find writing courses difficult at all
at any level
that ive taken
so no worries
props to ya!

Abgs don't call themselves abg
imagine labeling someone a cholo/chola
<@!345083648124649485> : AnOTheR One BIteS The DuSt
They just murder you
Yes sandy
bc of how they dress, thtsWACK
and not until I met Nina did I know the REAL definition of an ABG
ohp
tell me
I thought I described what a real abg was
wat isthe real definition of abg
and thts how ppl use the abg term nowadays
At one point
there is no respecr given
brb sandy pulling it up
LOLLL okie
Ngl though. People using the abg term loosely low-key made me forget what a real abg was
tbh kids in my area throw it around bc..... we dont have any actual abgs in our area LMAOOOO

ucsd got a lotta azns so it be nice
anaheim hills...... definitely..... interesting......

thERE SI NOTHING HERE
wheres anaheim hills?
also wauw i did not know abg was historically rooted <@!286708165612011531> ty ninu
is it just beyond anaheim?
Near anaheim
Oh right now I remember
it is technically anaheim
What I was going to say
east anaheim
ye! it's a cultural thing for sure, if ppl weren't a part of tht lifestyle or if they didn't live in oc, they dunno
closer to yorba linda / corona
ohh yorba area
I wish I connected with my latinx peeps more at school but idk I just haven't connected
> ye! it's a cultural thing for sure, if ppl weren't a part of tht lifestyle or if they didn't live in oc, they dunno
<@!286708165612011531> yas yas ty we love being educated ~~
There are people out there that get upset on abg gatekeeping. But it's the truth. 
You can't change that.
def were east azn and other se azn abgs besides viet ones but viet were hella prevalent
lol sandy drive into gg/westminster/fv and youll meet a lot of us
Like I remember some girl on Sat spoke the truth about abgs and the comments were nasty. Because they were offended people
The truth being most abgs aren't abgs
or she can drive to SD and meet all of us
when school starts :)
> lol sandy drive into gg/westminster/fv and youll meet a lot of us

Hi steph
stoof is like
have u ever played hs club vball
hello everyone
"volleyball"
"yes"
i played club + hs
i meant like precollegiate club so perfect
so college club is really similar
tryout in fall (hopefully this will happen), season is all of winter qtr
club dues are about 700 i think?
dragon boat
they'll probably let volleyball happen again if they find a way to sanitize the ball right away everytime someone hits it
<a:hahakek:676470025317777484>
and that covers hotel and tourney fees
a tryout oh shit
i am rusty as hell
<:scream:688600057616007190>
just dont be rusty
we have tourneys maybe every other week or so
lmao arent we all

yeah understandable, we've had to move our treadmill or fold it up sometimes bc not enough room
theyre just expensive dawg

med school <:Pepe_MonkaChrist:612363181318209562>
yeah i want to be a neurologist
wauw
lol most bio ppl i know are neuro ppl
ive only seen like 2 neuro people in this chat
idk if i want to go premed just yet so for now it‚Äôs pre PA
LOL
unless i change my major to marine bio and do a 360
<a:ohohoho:636686946734964786>
marine bio is cool
marine bio minor
There are no neuroscience kiddos here.
i kinda want to minor in cog sci
just cuz
thats a flex
the counselor suggested it to me and it seemed like a good idea
I minored in psychology after switching from clinical.
yeah i was also considering the marine science minor
i dont think id have to do much extra work for a cog sci minor
When you have your minor before your major <a:sadshaky:670539217905909770>
from what i saw
would be nice
but depends on what i can squeeze in to still graduate in 2022
i dont want to go over if i can avoid it
Who else are premedical buddies on here?
me
i think
LOL
dope
depends on my willpower
Switch to neuroscience. Come to the dark si-
and whether i actually want to commit to that many years in med school
i definitely want to go to med school
You can learn about cool stuff. Like neuroscience.
and neurons
i just want grad school
And science!
and then im done
med school is scary
the scientific method
thats my favorite part
can i just take a neuroscience class
LOL
My health is too poor for medical school.
LOL
me
I recommend BIPN 160.
Neuroanatomy
ok bet
all this fucking coursework so far as been everything but
ANATOMY
neuroscience
LUL
o-chem
PHYSIOOOOLOGYYYY
gen bio
calc
It‚Äôs a bit challenging though.
WHERE IS THE NEURO!????????
F
i didnt think i was a chem major
i wish there was a physio major tho
there isnt?
The neuroscience comes when you get good(tm)
There was.
Physiology and Neuroscience
heart breaking
You‚Äôre about two years too late
I WOULD LOVE THAT
<:pain2:706947574732423188>
i know davis has physio
It‚Äôs just neurobiology now.
being born in 2000 is a satisfying year
i didnt apply to ucd xD
Yeah when you‚Äôre old and senile you won‚Äôt forget your name
We used to have physio
davis calls it neurobiology, physiology and behavior
I mean age o
and u can choose a route
and one of them is physio
ucsb has physio too
that might have been more your cup of tea
Virgin physio versus chad Neurobio

That the appendix is essentially useless
no u
i think something that really surprised me that the butt is actually three muscles and not just one LMAOOOO
matt's an appendix basically
I am useless thanks for noticing
<:cursedab:640362029609385995>
matt
The butt is what now
have u ever owned a samsung galaxy
and if so
Yes
S6 edge plus
how do they shape up to the pixel
o
Slow
Er
i wanna either get a galaxy note or pixel soon
They're just fancy bodies
gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, and gluteus minimus
time to work out all three bad boys for a bigger booty
New note is coming soon. Same with pixel a month later
yee
Obviously pixel is cheaper
I think one of my favs is that when there‚Äôs no light or little light
The only thing is Samsung devices probably have much better battery life. Hopefully the 5th pixel fixes that and if it does
I'll buy it
<:feelsweirdman:671659510317711390>

lbut like
apparently ternansky is really difficult, so i dont want to take him
if i can avoid it
but again
need more options
to weigh against
I swear if it‚Äôs phineas gage
But yes Nick. The overall used experience is very very good on pixel
that thing where ur left and right eye are like switched and you can only like say a picture out loud on one side and draw a pic on the other side
oh yes
i just want a laid back o-chem prof that doesnt make the subject harder than it already is
idk ppl abt psych i self studied i could‚Äôve cared less abt the ppl CHSINFS
OH
i dont want some hardass psycho that kills students with ridiculously difficult shit
PHINEAS GAGE

Hello sir I am awake with you as well

ANYWAY GOOD MORNING
Good morning all welcome to the end!
good morning gamerrzzz
> Good morning all welcome to the end!
<@!213151486434082817> this sounded ominous
but ya mornin cuties!
Good morning ‚òÄÔ∏è
Ehh end of week 9, or the world take it as you please lol
we in the home stretchh
so stonks
weclome to the club!
i know how to type properly
welcome!
<:cacodemon:713483943969554483>
but wait tomer, have you been investing in stonks?
welcome welcome
nop
i don't know where to look for advice in this lol
I know some things cus my dad did/does
yeah its kinda meh
ahh i see isee
hello welcome :3
tldr index is pretty safe when the economy is stable
but if you want quick profits
you'd have to research and do like
day trading
cus it doesnt really yield that much if you just plop everything into dow
yeah im not looking for anything quick quick
well depends how much you have also but yeah
yeah
yearly quick is a thing though lol
I would say go safe over profit
or by the quarter
cus at the end of the day, it is very easy to lose tons of money too
exactly
The thing with day trading is that its just educated gambling
yeah
at least imo
I wouldnt tell you to do that
cus one its a lotta work
and its never guaranteed
like you can have all the DD and shit like that and it can still turn out super bad
ye
same with options, cause youre either betting on the company to gain a lot by said time
less of a risk though if youre doing proper research
but also, this isnt really an opportune time to get into stocks; what with the whole global pandemic and halt of manufacturing
i mean investments in health and tech can yeild a lot
true
imagine if you bought zoom stocks 3 months ago
whew
I have a lot of missed moments, where I was putting in money on things based on a hunch
welcome <@!397981106370117643>  !
like there was this one called docusign, a company that does pdf signing, trading at $40 when it became public now at 120
this was a couple years ago, but like if i had money then to just keep it in ugh
dam
Welcome!! <:banzai:442185100273123328>
welcome welcome
Docusign
I‚Äôve heard of that
also another business that was super shady, but gained like 1100% in a week and i sold when they stated dropping
ooh ever used it?
it's a pretty big company now, lots of ppl use it to sign forms/agreements
I think they have internships <:kek:490008924414803968>
yeah i used it a couple times to sign NDAs or send out contracts
super convienient tbh
Yuh
I think I had to sign a waiver and somebody was like just use this
What are peoples plans for today?
code
and then more coding
short break of league
then more coding
tell myself im gonna do work but then not
also a mood
but we pray for you henry
I just remembered I had a mandatory discussion today
And then a meeting
And then homework until I die
im, just here wallowing in the fact that im procrastinating
I really need to fix my sleep schedule
Like I‚Äôm getting my 8 hrs but it‚Äôs just kinda yikes. It‚Äôs 4 am - 12 pm everyday
I mean
as long as you're not missing anything important
I dont see why having that sleep schedule is bad other than the fact that society deems it "bad"
because its associated with gamers that are lazy
we lib in a society
<:pepehands:464568955533524992>
But yea, I don't think "fixing your sleep schedule" is necessary unless you're sleeping through classes or missing important stuff
ha...ha....
or or or just take like 20 naps throughout the day lol
scientifically speaking ur sleep schedule is best aligned with the day night cycle iirc
or at least a consistent one
it‚Äôs a good feeling to be up and seeing the sun just rising
ye my parents would just prefer a 12am-8am sleep schedule
and its prob best
for my actual schedule
of classes and stuff
but i just sleep through my classes <:kek:490008924414803968>
me too jenny
i have a 3 am 12 pm sched rn lol
XD
my mom
walks in every day
and looks at my disappointedly
üôÇ
I mean at least you get 8 hours Jenny lol
ye
i used to get like 4
ngl
Ohp
saaaaaaaame
See small victories lol
bc stress and nightmares
Oh no
bc school yeet
winter quarter i slept so little holy shite
it was a very stressful times, issok ive gotten past it mostly
Ehh I mean it‚Äôs better than mine where I sleep around 2-3 ish and wake up around 6-8 ish
üò¢
It‚Äôs okie I take a lot of mental breaks through out the day to just be a potato
üëç
naps
I don‚Äôt even nap lol
Well sometimes
Well sometimes
But like right now I‚Äôm just laying in bed
nice nice
oml 96.25 gb for warzone D:
Not worth
<:PEPESCREAM:466446495747670027>

gm gamers
good morning jef
randy do you ever play
aim lab
HELLLO FRIENDS
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ9ZdjvNVA
THE COVER IS HERE!!!!!
ok i see u litto üòª
ummm i don't do aim lab or kovak's, a lot of people do
> THE COVER IS HERE!!!!!
<@!242544930528952321> 
OKAY OKAAAAY
I main jsut use aim bots and free for all dm
<@!144994874570047488>
but umm thats not really a thing in valorant
<@!144994874570047488> what do u need aim lab for tho <:Thonk:264701195573133315>
nothin
its just fun x)
.-.
osu!
kekeke
i mean
its free so
yeah i hear its just a worse kovakks
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm going to do randy
I‚Äôm going to start learning osu! For aim practice kek
But also helps with reaction time
lol i don't use it for aim prac, but if its for just learning to click dots then go for it kekeke
i mean i feel like osu would be more memorization no?
site reading is all reaction
yea but thats assuming you're only playing every map once
turn on hidden?
i mean if you play a bunch of maps and never really go back to the same one too often its not really ever memorized
That‚Äôs me
That‚Äôs what I was doing in clone hero anyways
And pump it up lol
for me reaction time isn't really something i can work on in game
Kinda have to be doing sports or being active irl to help speed up your reaction time
or quick boost to it that doesn't last, caffeine
Yeah. I heard exercising improves brain so you have faster reaction time because brain healthy
my average reaction time when I was still more physically active was around 170 ms, now its around 200 ms lolol
but this is through different sites and in game clients
i think most pros are around 140 ms?
> THE COVER IS HERE!!!!!

extra legs

<:shook:606018427018149889>
my thought process is a large atonks
if u turned into a spider .... your power over humans would be astronomical

time to snatch lara
we're getting u outta there
<:bulbaowo:615441070033207307>
my house is just
conservative asians
yikes
and u kno where it goes from there <:zoop:435223493311725573>
my parents would get along with yours then
i just have like drastically differing opinions w my dad so it is very tense
same
hmm i feel like they aren't as hardcore as yours
my parents are hardcore Catholics and republicans
they're not as condemning towards homosexuality as yours are but i know they think it's weird or something
luckily i was raised in a more chill religion ewfuboiwebsdv
My parents pray the rosary everyday and have meetings for their church group
And watch a bunch of videos
ohp <:POGGERS:699392343920476223>
wait
Yes
what is praying the rosary
Oh uhh
You pray the same prayers for like 20 minutes
i came out to my mom and she was upset and then i asked her months later if it was ok if i brought a girl home
It‚Äôs tiring because I hate repeating myself
and she laughed and went "what a funny joke, if you do i might get a heart attack" so tht was the end of it
i-
it's ok but like not ok?
ykno?
yeah i feel like
sometimes u just. don't argue with a Viet Mom
viets arent like outspoken but it's like they think its weird
u right
Oh <:FeelsBadMan:441463646124507136>
i think
My parents didn‚Äôt want me to date anyone regardless
when it comes to asian parents, you need to ease them into any kind of potentially shocking news if possible but ultimately, it's not our job to try to make tht ultimately comfortable for them
u right
Yes
and them being "older" and "ignorant" shouldn't ever be an excuse to not educate, but sometimes u just gotta conserve ya energie
she's important!
you give off the same vibes as my other cousin
she is constantly telling me to educate my parents LOL
it's p impt! but then like sometimes im like ah shit im talking to a wall
yeah ik thats the thing i have problems w hefjbd
i forgot the terms but my dad likes to use many argumentative tactics to get around my point and do a loop as to why ... he's right <:feelsbadman:584486296097914911>
I find it hard to talk to my parents <:pepehands:464568955533524992>
Because I have big anxiety <:peepocry:640363747990306827>
<:PeepoCry:694447846056787998>
it seems like i can talk to lara's parents more than lara can

<:pepehmm:671658873526157323>
oh i mean with violin i understand, because its a lot easier to control since you have better control over the instrument
but with like a trumpet on trombone theres so much leverage and its easy for it to bounce out
Like from my own experience marching even in a straight line is hard
hmmmm i drank a bit, but i don't even feel it
:0
how many shots <:monkaS:442185930867081218>
bold of you to assume its shots
randy on his 2nd handle: *huh?*

<a:sheepglasses:690065424259219470>
tht amt would have be sprawled backwards over the arm of a loveseat

onetime my cousin had open bar at his wedding and we were having drinks all night lol
but like lets say like 15 shots?
idk i haven't counted lol

<@!493178993814798346>
it's a card game where you guess either the number, suit, or color
each time you get it wrong you drink
each time you get it wrong you drink
and they have an extra little thing at the end where you can give shots to your friends

woo spacex launch today
Eh i dont like Musk or SpaceX lmao
Sketchy ass man with sketchy ass company
thats fine, but think of it this way. Our own government isn't trying to do anyhting with space anymore
and its one of the few launches that we'll probably have as part of our generation
True, but not exactly NASA‚Äôs fault
i never said it was nasa's fault now did i?
I said our government wasn't trying to do it
NASA is severely underfunded and our government prioritizes military spending over research
NASA is severely underfunded and our government prioritizes military spending over research
Oh true
But honestly its really sad
yeah, but im not trying to get into the politics of it. just taking in the moment
i dont think there's enough motivation for our govt to put money into space development anyways
since the space industry has already been privatized
yeah, so like I think its fine if you don't like musk or his company, but having someone fund space exploration and things of the sort is what I find good
Yea
I mean the whole "comercialize" space is iffy
but like we need to be able to get there before we can debate that issue lol
good morning again to everyone just waking up
good morning gamers!!
i just dreamed that i was on a ship that was about to capsize bc of really large waves so i, along with others, had to hold a kid to my chest as well as a railing at the same time
shit was traumatizing
omg
Should I try champagne
<:isathonk:657297620540194836>
everyone watch the launch :0 T-15 mins ish
t-4 minutes
t-2 mins
> Should I try champagne
<@!245736329382461440> yes, bubbly alc!
Yes champagne is where it‚Äôs at
LAUNCHHHH
wooooo
LAJKSHFDIWUEHFLKAJSDF
ship has gone brrr
look at that ploom
whew
rocket has gone BRRR
iirc, it's a 9 min flight to orbit???
I wanna see them land
the first stage
oof
only the first stage
tomer i thought they were just gonna recall th
well Idk if the seond stage is recoverable
stage two go BRRRRR
<@!324701936593141760> i only know know all of these rocket terms bc of that seminar thing you made me go to
n o m i n a l = good
Something something _nominal trajectory_
Damn we‚Äôre almost at a point where we can say it was successful
rockets are cool
What makes me pretty sad is that people are still going to say this is fake
:((((
OH SHIT
falcon 9 actually landed
stage one landedd
POGGG
They made it
camera cut out on landing
big gsad
haha their ‚ÄúI still love you‚Äù
yeah
hahaha
Aww it‚Äôs so cool
wait there was a little dinosaur thingy D:
His souvineer from home
awwwww
wait where was the dinosuar?
dragon separation confirmed
lmao they are doing like
"thanks for choosing united"
YEAH
Omg 19 hours
delta airlines bois
bumpy ass ride
thanks for choosing spacex dragon, hope to see you again next time
pulled > 2.3 G but thats ok
Rip stage 2
stage 2 never lands xD
They should have it burn up
space junk
nah
is that thing just floating in space now
Yeah
F
p much lmao
thats the trunk right
We have a lot of trash in space
the trunk?
Yeah they lost the boot
Kekeke
LMFAO
we have a lot of trash on earth too üôä
19 hours in that little capsule
Rip all their food
holy moly
wait
19 hours???
thats insane
Sad that I‚Äôm part of that trash
why didnt they just
THEY TOOK OFF HELMETS
no, me <@!213151486434082817> üò†
HAHAHAHA
rocket the rocket into the ISS
And yeah they have to wait for the ISS to meet them
what
the iss is orbiting
that would be hard to hit
bruh they think the astronauts can sleep
????
AHHAHAHAHA
Like they are basically on a collision course with it
instead they match the orbit
yeah
i know
that would be funny
if they just
insta dock with the ISS
nYOOM
We need the space elevator now
crashes into iss
takes out the entire station
This is just the beginning
yeeeee
i think we needed this
at least one thing good has happened
The one piece of good news in this shithole of a year
they are really emphasizing american american american
<@!493178993814798346> my sentiments exactly
and yeha
theyre like
ALL AMERICAN
AMERICAN ROCKET
I mean yeah this is a really patriot thing
AMERICAN ASTRONAUTS
as if the soyuz rockets havent been successfully for ages
oop
lmfao
Yeah but I think it‚Äôs the fact that more nations are becoming space faring again
nah i mean
us aastronauts would just get launched using soyuz rockets
space exploration is still a pretty collaborative thing
Oh yeah, idk I guess they are like it feels good that we‚Äôre able to produce our own as well again
ISS is like a buncho nations
yeah for sure
Damn those suits look so good though lol
but like, they are overly politicizing it when imo its mostly all spaceX's doing
You‚Äôre right, though
brrrr
next up
Artemis
les go
Ooh
i think elon's net worth just increased
Tesla and space x about to shoot up in price again
hmmm
"i was praying"
I think falure rate was like
.2 %
Hmm that‚Äôs pretty good lol
yeah I mean
it only took around 6 months but finally something good happened x
d
Andrew did you end up changing?
the falcon 9 has launched before
yea i sent the request
just the capsule is new
Oh yeah, but like putting up people in space is alaways a thing that you just cross you‚Äôre fingers for even if it‚Äôs a low low low percent
true
yo, whatd yall think about that space launch
very nice
pretty clean
sad we didnt get to see the landing burn
rip ocisly camera
What‚Äôs sad about the previous space failures, at least from what I read in my class this time is that they could have been prevented but bad leadership and a lot of government and social pressure caused them to launch
my mom was confused cuz she found it really weird that it was just a "test" (i didnt know they were going to the ISS so i told her i guessed it was just coming back down)
yeah
If we got to see the landing that would be amazing
you can look up prior missions
oh wat was that falcon thing or watever
where they show the landing feed
that they did show landed afterwards
its super awesome
space failures of spacex, or like early nasa rockets?
Yeah, it looks sick
NASA
Sorry I wasn‚Äôt clear
yee
That was the falcon rocket garret
gotta beat teh reds u know
the stage one falcon 9 is what landed
so they discard stage 2?
But Falcon rockets had failures before but those were all unmanned
Yeah stage 2 is just left up there in space
that was part of the manned rocket they sent up right?
Yeah
my mom was like
ohh they saved stage 1?
they landed??
and stage 2 is abandoned?
already??
Yup
first manned mission with falcon 9
ok thats what i assumed lol
did yall know, the falcon 9 heavy is basically a beefed up version with a buncho previous gen rockets strapped on as boosters?
I find that
peak enginir
first launch in a while in the usa
i think since 2011ish?
yeah
Yeah sounds about right
since the spaceshuttle
space x: hmmm hw do we innovate a new engine to get ppl back into space
also space x: lets just stick a bunch of old rockets together
I remember them bringing the space shuttles to LA and seeing it just fly over my school
the new missions get hand me downs
"old" like 1 year old but yeah
xD
The new engine innovation is the fact that we can bring it back
yes

wait did someone ping me i cant find it
yes in one of the bot lands but its okay it was nothing important
dw sandy it was a stupid bot thing

now yeeted
tl;dr t-slur is still a slur no matter how you try and spin it
*any slur is still a slur no matter how you try and spin it*
there it is !
not like it was also missle ginny stick too or whateva
the only situation I can think of where there's more of a gray area with slurs is when a slur is being reclaimed by the group it targets however how the bot was using it clearly was Not It
Wait, what happened with poke cord?
<@!203407962302185472>
Oof
Holy shit, what?
<:pain:713285895419330591>
Why??
Wasn't really clear, but the developer said it was due to "added work and stress"
He probably got a job somewhere...
We may never really know but I too am saddened by this as Pokecord was something I used daily to pass time and connect with people
Yeah, I have good memories of catching Pokemon with people too. Sad to see it go
aight, now's our chance, we're gonna make the next iteration of pokecord
Yes I do wish the best for the creator
Seems like hes got a lot on his plate
hi yall i posted it in <#453790820886380544> but my org commission on warren spirit is currently playing skribblio and later hopefully jackbox

NP NP we're going until 8!
LA city curfew
8 pm
I mean, it‚Äôs not like people are going out anyways
people are actually
to protest
but anyway bring it to probably current-news
if u have anything to say
just putting this out therr
<@!219584106550263809> not that I know of
Honestly implementing pokecord would take a month max with a team of 3-4 people
Not the worst idea
<:wuh:440237146998046730>
concept
:^)
Bet
good thing we have the waifu bot to wipe away our tears
this is really sad
i have a question
is there extra maintenance you have to constantly do to keep a bot running on discord?
i know some of you guys made bots here
hellir
should human bio take the chem placement test
uhh
i dont think so

<@!286708165612011531> I would be careful about posting stuff about the protests on social media since the fbi can look through your browser history AND your phone  without a warrent (thanks Patriot Act)!
They cant legally unlock a password protected phone BUT they can use your fingerprint and face ID
Plus they can also look into any of your friends/ family
This goes for everyone else too, take necessary precautions and stay safe!
pardon?
Was referring to the fb post lol
Just be careful
???
I would delete anything incriminating in your browser history rn lmao
i
pardon?
I don't think we have anything to hide
if thats what your insinuating
youre*
Thats not the problem tho
wilson imma have to ask you to elaborate furthur
The government can p much use anythibgb against you if they wanted
Why would someone be looking at a bunch of random college students
there's no reason to single us out from the crowd
yes plz use my spotify playlists against me
They arrest hella college stufents and ppl at protests
thats the thing
_at_ protests
AT the protests
And stop them with tear gas
are we out there rn?
no
are we raising awareness for the situation?
yes
social media is still a form of protest tho
Im not saying dont do it
Im saying be careful
The fact that the patriot act even exists disgusts me
if i were to be arrested for looking at protest-related social media, i wouldn't be here anymore lol
Yea but the passing of the patriot act could mean new rules for the internet
https://www.facebook.com/groups/ucsdvsa/?post_id=10157286677599013
wilson the way that you just @ nina specifically was very call-out like. ik you just wanted to say "be careful", but this isn't the way to do it. times like these are very sensitive and sitting back and doing nothing does not help at all
she's bringing awareness to the situation for those that might not be able to be at the protests themselves
Was it? My bad I wasnt trying to call anyone out
She was the only one i saw so thats why i mentioned it
I know you mean well Wilson, but I think you're worrying a bit too much. 
The Patriot Act isn't used against people who aren't already targets anyway...
Ofc i dont mean take it down
If you're undocumented, or have a shaky student visa, or are crossing the US border anytime soon, perhaps be more careful. Otherwise, if you're safe, by all means, spread awareness
there are also literally millions of people on this earth and on social media. the "authorities" arent going to be nitpicking someone's online presence unless they actually had a reason to
she and anyone else that is posting about this is not doing anything wrong. those that may raise concerns are those that are inciting violence, calling for violent riots, etc
its def important to know that your online footprint is trackable, but there are many people who are much more radical posting stuff all over the internet, and nina merely posted about things to keep in mind and the significance of recent events
she has nothing to hide
with all due respect i'm very confused on why my ^^^^post can be used against me in any way when it is a way to inform; i know my rights to freedom of speech and also my consequences. however, i am not inciting any hateful actions or speech. it was a way to educate and compile necessary information for a community that i knew needed a big push in leaning into the discomfort of supporting the black community, which has been leeched from and also besmirched by ppl like me : D
Yea but they still CAN access your history and I think that is very important. The police are handling these protests very poorly and honestly what they are doing is unconstitutional. Im not saying anything WILL happen Im saying anything CAN happen. By all means spread awareness but also take some steps to protect yourself. Thats all im saying.
I worry about ppl thats all
i'll be honest, i've looked up some pretty sketchy stuff sometimes out of curiosity <:kek:490008924414803968>
thanks for worrying but dw those that post informative things know what theyre doing and how to protect themselves
Sometimes I shout stuff about drone bombs and the White House near my smart speaker just to piss my FBI agent off
Nothing happens
privacy is spooky
<@!286708165612011531> your freedom of speech is VERY IMPORTANT so we have to let these jackasses know that we wont step down. They will do everything they can to stop these protests without real change so by mentioning these injustices you already stick out from the crowd. Yknow what i mean?
I remember reading an article about these reporters that went to talk to snowden and he had them put all devices with an antennae in the freezer to block any possible signals
sometimes i wish my fbi agent would reach out to me and ask if i was okay ü•∫ üëâ üëà
lmao she's not the only one doing it wilson
Remember the Panama Papers? Whistleblower got MURDERED
I know
But shes my friend
And i want her to be safe
I tell this to all my friends btw im not singling you out
i appreciate the words of caution but in this case i have been a vessel of information and any calls to action, as yall can read in the link above, is DIRECTLY connected to what the azn community can do to unlearn their personal biases, and re-educate themselves and their loved ones. i genuinely do not know why the govt would target a 5'4 viet hooligan bitch who posted in a social/cultural org's community page to educate other ppl abt what they can do to help black ppl from being slaughtered but ya
"5'4 viet hooligan bitch" omg
u forgot ur üëë  queen
tea served biggo ugh your mind
so powerful
she's a ninagan
Its because the Trump Administration knows the people are not happy with the government. Just remember our country is rum by old powerful rich ppl
DONT TAKE YOUR RIGHTS FOR GRANTED FIGHT FOR THEM
wilson... that's what she's doing...
???????????
wait
alsjkdhflakuwhfkajsfd
that's literally-
Yes
Just do it SAFE
i cannot right now
Thats what i was gonna end with
> tea served biggo ugh your mind
<@!242544930528952321> i adore u litto
i don't get why this isn't safe lol

how much safer can i get
Generally I have a VPN
Encrypts my data
wilson its
Id start with that
not that serious
^^
its a valid concern
but TRULY
it is NOT that serious
it really . is not that serious
i don't see any reason why u'd use a vpn to raise awareness xd
ur not doing anything illegal either ? ur just speaking up

no
how it goes matt
How is it not serious that the fbi can access your info whenever they want?
It is serious. But none of us are at risk right now.
^^
nina is not at risk either
her post
which is why we use our voices to protect those who are
was informative and barely mentioned her personal opinions
no one is at risk unless they're actually advocating for violence that is punishable
<a:monkaCough:713632323995959376>

damn
just getting to the chorus
the good part boiii
but ok
ill stop
You‚Äôre no all star, Wilson
lmao
but i am
jkjk im a fucking king
that songs stuck in my head now lmao
i used to know the whole song at some point i think
idk if i still do tho
damn i used to just like spend my time memorizing meme songs
what did i do with my life lmao
and like watch anime
my weeb phase was hella bad
like i was like full on weeb
like anime merch like everything
i remember there was like this one anime kiosk that opened in our mall
and when i heard i was like ooooooh shit
but like everything there was hella expensive
so i was like helllll naw
but tbh i feel
that if i had the money
i wouldve like bought out their entire stack
stock*
you feel?
thats not even like where it ends tho
i watched like soo much anime
like i watched like the deep shit yknow
the shit that like no one really knows about
like the shit that doesnt even have like proper subs
and you gotta like get a scanlation/ sub from some sketchy person in china or smnh
but yea obvi i got bullied a lot for being a weeb lmao
but like honestly tho
i feel like because i was bullied
i watched more anime
bc it was like an escape ya feel?
like especially a lot of like romance animes
bc i wanted a gf
and i was in like middle school lmao
so id like watch hella shoujo and harem shit
and like read too obvi
and i was like damn
i wish i was popular
but at least im popular in the anime world jkjk
like not even lol
it would be cool if they made like an anime about me tho
idk what itd be about
but i have pondered the thought like a lot
i feel like my life aint interesting enough to have an anime made about me  tho
oh i watched a lot of like isekai too
bc like literal escapism lmaooo
but yea after like sophomore year i kinda grew out of my anime phase
and into my idk wtf im doing phase
where im literally unsure about everything
also lmao senior year was also the time i was diagnosed with adhd
so like i had it my whole life and i didnt even know it apparently?
or maybe i didnt and the doc is wack who knows
but i always wonder if i like actually have adhd
or if tje doctor was just wack
but then i was like
if i did or didnt its not like id have anything to compare to
since i wouldnt know how "normal" ppl thought
but like i kinda feel like i prob do
bc i get distracted a lot
and i also go on tangents sometimes
like if you ask me about something i like to talk about
i will literally go on like forever
like ill p much keep talking for a while
but i feel like thats prob annoying
since i dont want to like hog the convo
but i also just get like so into it yknow?
that sometimes i dont even realize im doing it
but like i try to limit myself
and contain my excitement
so to speak i guess
but yea that was a p jarring discovery lol
I've done the same thing before. I always worry now that I talk too much...
sometimes I just want to hear the other person say something and they don't even realize it
lmao riight?
also jfc i typed a lot
yea i just get way too into my mind lol
and forgot
that i have a midterm due in a few hours holy shit
good luck!
holy fuck its also week 10
thank you!
no week 10 starts on Monday :P
u right
plus its not tomorrow until i sleep
mood
uhhh oh also about the patriot act thing
just want to clear some points up before i leave:
1. Yes you may not be doing anything illegal but at this point the govnt might make up some bs excuse to incriminate you
2. just stay safe
thats all
thanks folks
don't think thats gonna happen, the general public is gonna have too big of a freedom boner to let that happen
thats what i thought too but the fact that the new bill passed make me very very wary
govt is sketchyyyyyyy af
which one?
the one that allowed the fbi to look at browser history and stuff
just passed like i want to say last month??
das a yikes and i think your concerns are valid
however, if no one is being suuper radical or getting in anyones face directly, i highly doubt the fbi can monitor every single american
the probability of being.. investigated? is not zero but it is very close to zero
did I mention my fortnut drone bomb
LMAO
https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/6172/text
yall can read bout it if you want
as long as you know thats good
everything else is up to you
Update, May 14: The Patriot Act reauthorization bill passed the Senate on Thursday, without the Wyden-Daines amendment (but with an amendment from Sens. Leahy and Lee that added some independent oversight to the FISA court). The vote was 80-16. Murray, now back in DC, was among the no votes

wdym? Vox is usually pretty trustworthy in my experience
yea but still a secondary source
so prone to bias
true
but yea vox is p good about their sources and stuff
<:thonk:440231969796784128>
Oh we are reading about the Patriot Act
That was always gonna happen
to repeal the Patriot Act would take insurrection
FREEDOM Act is just Obamas version
Which includes some nice provisions
I don't remember if FREEDOM was the bill that included the provision allowing Drone killings of US Citizens
Or if that was one of the other smaller bills
Thanks Obama
Taking our liberties away epic gamer style
More like thanks political institution that indoctrinates everyone who touches it
;-;
Theres always core stuff that no politician will change
Thanks Dianne Feinstein
Its ok guys they aren't voting on FISA (even though technically most of it exists via other bills anyway)
<a:ohohoho:636686946734964786>
Oh and of course its a nice coverup for the other surveillance bills they were totally willing to try and pass
Though I can't talk my country is as bad, its just more honest about it
where are you from?

school does not allow me to do that
i've only ate dinner for the past 4 days
<:thonK:500668461501120525>
but I feel fine
Yum
<:yeet:442868651792793601>  you're not lurking
I mean
At least you're eating
true
It would be worse if you said you only ate a dinner in the past 4 days
<:xd:612726759846051861>
I mean its comparable to one of my regular meals <:xd:612726759846051861>
<:aha:612044524927057921>
Wtf
If you guys go on snapchat and go to the snapmap look at la mesa
yeah I heard about the vons
I think James posted it in <#687107060961378331>
wildin
yeah its p insane
i definitely feel like its gone too far
usually that warrants more change, but I can't really say much
at this point these ppl arent tryna send a message but trying to bring home a 50inch tv
really now, walmart and vons being the targets
not necessarily everyone but yes there will always be that group of people
no matter what
people will always take advantage of events
yeah thats true
and its sad to see
The people who are breaking shit just to break shit and looting for no reason are not actual legitimate protesters
^
I feel like there are people there to incite violence and to demean what should be peaceful protests
But goodmorning to everyone on this last day of may in the year of 2020ay
It‚Äôs almost June wtf
This year so far was a shitshow
Wtf they burned down a chase bank <:monkaS:442185930867081218>
Scrolling through twitter literally got me crying
Someone I know was in la mesa taking videos
they got the MTG card shop
that'll show the police
Personally, I think if you use a mans death as an excuse to steal a TV its pretty disgusting
wait where *is* la meda
like east
it's close to sdsu
if you know where that is
They should‚Äôve left small businesses alone :/
ikr
Damn maybe if the police weren‚Äôt disrupting peaceful protests by firing rubber bullets in full riot gear they‚Äôd be able to do something about it huh
ohh
It‚Äôs almost counterproductive for small businesses specifically though
Especially black owned businesses that have already suffered as a result of covid19
Something tells me that the people who are likely not protesters that are going for those shops anyway never actually cared for the cause nor small businesses in the first place
Yeah true
Also places where the police responded peacefully have actually kept the protests peaceful
Imagine that <:wotthink:441465363671154698>
D:
it‚Äôs hard to characterize the affiliation or reasoning of who did what but we can all agree that looting and striking small businesses aint it? Regardless of who did it
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
Any looting is bad period
And I support those standing their ground where they can
There‚Äôs a real good reason for people to protest, other places have shown it can be peaceful
"The mystifying ideological claim that looting is violent and non-political is one that has been carefully produced by the ruling class because it is precisely the violent maintenance of property which is both the basis and end of their power. Looting is extremely dangerous to the rich (and most white people) because it reveals, with an immediacy that has to be moralized away, that the idea of private property is just that: an idea, a tenuous and contingent structure of consent, backed up by the lethal force of the state. When rioters take territory and loot, they are revealing precisely how, in a space without cops, property relations can be destroyed and things can be had for free."
https://thenewinquiry.com/in-defense-of-looting/
just some food for thought
Yeah I can never ever get behind that. The law is the law <:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
That‚Äôs just my opinion though
oki
Mm I agree that the law should be obeyed but the law is just rules made by the oppressors dontcha think
And when the laws don‚Äôt define justice u need reform
No, laws exist in all countries
And when the oppressors don‚Äôt respond to peace
Well
:/
You can protest, you can speak
It works in other areas
That hasn‚Äôt done anything here
For years
Don‚Äôt deface the name of someone who died
Yeah and there is oppression in like all countries lmao?
And bring attention away from the actual cause
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
Slavery was law before
You realize that right
The police department that killed that man were pieces of shit, but nobody cared when they killed foreigners
And they killed more than one
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
It‚Äôs not just one person, it‚Äôs not just one act of violence, it‚Äôs literally hundreds of years of systematic racism.
This isn‚Äôt just for George Floyd anymore
I‚Äôm sorry but I just cannot ever get behind violence.
No one believes hurting small business is right
It‚Äôs for racism in general
It‚Äôs starting to become more than that
A fight against general racism with George Floyd at its core
The violence is only started when agitators are introduced, and when a people are never heard
Peaceful protests started at taking a knee and people didn't like that either so
I‚Äôm more of a pacifist myself but there‚Äôs things you can‚Äôt solve with peace
Outside agitators sure are a big part of this
Even foreign nations
But, that‚Äôs for the national intelligence to deal with
But when the agitators are white supremacists and opportunists who are the ones made to look bad?
it took almost a century for women to have the right to vote. We are fighting an uphill battle so it‚Äôll definitely take some time.
Thankfully piblic opinion is shifting tho
All I want to say Sam is that violence wasn‚Äôt the first answer and breaking and looting wasn‚Äôt brought in by the peaceful protestors
Pretty quickly too with internet
It took a war to get rights and independence for the colonies and then another to get rid of slavery
The biggest changes and reform unfortunately was brought by violence
Thats true
I think looting in the name of a man who was killed is very disgusting
But whats the specific reform we are looking for rn
There were peaceful attempted made in both situations
If its just to end racism then a war wont do that
To start, police departments can‚Äôt investigate themselves
It‚Äôs just dumb
Its ok guys the boomers who run the country are dying
We are literally living in another civil rights movement, not to gain the rights but to protect and to have the rights of black people and all people of color their rights to actually be enforced and protected
Well get our chance
Start early start often :^)
Okay just wanted to make sure we are all on the same page
Carry on
YEN NO
that's PA forbidden speech
What
> Start early start often :^)
<@!245736329382461440>  these are true threats
What sucks is that saying the boomers are dying isn‚Äôt really what the problem is, it‚Äôs not just the older generation it‚Äôs people being taught and brought up in a racist system
Thats true
Although I do love a revolution, some times violence does makes things worse
No one is ever born racist
Gm gamers
Actually even before the police department thing
You learn the patriarchy
gm yall im at the hb protest rn
<:wuh:440237146998046730>
> The biggest changes and reform unfortunately was brought by violence
<@!186009830484344843> gonna second this one ya
stay safe dino
they called in a whole squadron and a chopper
Convict all four people that were a part of George‚Äôs murder
Stay safe <@!493178993814798346>
That‚Äôs the start
<@!493178993814798346> pls tell me you have a burner phone
Don‚Äôt get hurt
The born racist thing is not necessarily true but i get what you mean
Just be careful on that
Alex was born to play only ganondorf tho
Turn off everything for now
Thats true
<@493178993814798346> if u need anything lmk
^
<@!493178993814798346> And take your touch id/ face id OFF if you really there
Yeah just keep your location off
Just yeet it off
That too
airplane mode
Touch Id/face Id don't do much.
Yikes stay safe
Those are stored locally
Delete them
Its getting heated out there
if it turns sour have some phone number written on your skin
Fbi can access your phone through that
Honestly thats a good idea
But not passcode
> Those are stored locally
<@!314229461396488195> its more that police can't force you to give them ur passcode but touch/face id is fair game
Not if Diana forces the biometrics off
All she has to do is press her power button a million times I think
Or just turn the phone off
And if they turn it back on
Actually I don‚Äôt think police can legally force you to unlock
It's disabled
Regardless of method
They can technically
Really depends
They need a warrant
if they start placing jammers get out
just eat your phone
i mean, i feel like not legally doing a lot of things has kinda gone out the window no
When governments get desperate they will retaliate violently so just keep yoself safe
Like rn
Yeah honestly its really up in the air
Also
Placing too much faith in upholding the law rn is scawey
Covid didn‚Äôt disappear over night
Police might not care
Yeah
It did not
Beware large crowds Dino
Covid is still rampant
That too
Its a big reason for this huge push too
Stress of covid definitely didnt make anything easier
But hey who cares they reopened restaurants and bars and people had large gatherings at beaches so everything is fine now right?
Yeah i mean
...
they're reopening disneyland
idk why
If im ahppy right
but hey
perfect to get sick again
Because economy is better than human rights and human safety
Lots of people at these protests also not wearing masks
<:monkaS:442185930867081218>
The people that are actually protesting are
yeah
i can excuse racism but i draw the line at not getting a haircut /s
the people breaking in and looting aren't
wearing masks
The ones that are there to feel ‚Äúmorally good‚Äù for a day are t
Yeah
But still part of the crowd so stay safe if yall go out there
I believe everything can be solved with a BMW. If you wanna make a statement. Use force by BMW
<a:aniEvilPlan:657098437040537600>
The saddest shit is once this blows over if nothing is done to help these people out and actually make change we‚Äôll be fighting the same issue in another couple years
Yea just ram the barricades haha
^
Yeah
Or be a cop and run people over
<a:monkaShoot:699841146943176734>
I was gonna say, that's what the police did!
But hey that‚Äôs not being recorded soo it‚Äôs fair game right?
And all that is left is just thousands of hurt people and small businesses
Not if I buy a mustang and run the cops over first
<a:monkaShoot:699841146943176734>
If nothing happens
Hopefully somethign comes out of this
Corporate America will only feel the hit from this for a couple months sadly
Oh definitely
Im only concerned for small businesses
And homes
THEY BETTER NOT REOPEN DISNEY WE DONT EVEN HAVE A VACCINE YET
REEEEEE
they are planning too
sadly
Because itll impact their lives for decades if nothing happens
My friends story had gunshots in it when she was just chilling at home
Yikes
Yikes
Yea
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
But disney
Is not small
I‚Äôm not sure wether I‚Äôm hearing gun shots or fireworks again.
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fireworks season yet
There‚Äôs gonna be hella gunshots in Texas
My city has a protest going on rn and the shopping district
But I do hear the cops with sirens on at 2 am
We actually just had fireworks in ptown
the national guard landed in dtla at 3am
Scawey
Pretty worried there will be a mass shooting to be honest
for a protest that turned violent cuz of the cops
Also becareful our there people are talking about bringing out their guns to quell the protests
Viva la revolution
More like second civil war
> Also becareful our there people are talking about bringing out their guns to quell the protests
Dw if they‚Äôre white that‚Äôs ok \s
DO YOU HEAR THE PEOPLE SONG
Sing*
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
Actually
No \s
That‚Äôs literally already happened
They haven‚Äôt done shit about anyone with guns
At least not in Texas or Indiana
That‚Äôs how we got 4 dead people in Indiana
I love the casual let whites protest at our government buildings, because they wanted a haircut
Literal armed militias showing up
Protest with _assault rifle_
And they didn‚Äôt do anything
And trump says they‚Äôre ‚Äúgood people‚Äù
Got it
Y‚Äôall hear about how anonymous is back
yes
yeee
i saw the video
Yup
that shit is wild
they took down the Minneapolis website right
its been a while
Yeah
That‚Äôs actually crazy
2020 is literally a fucking movie u can not change my mind about this
Its not a movie
It's a series
Oh I wonder what June will have in store forces
<@!345083648124649485> lets watch 2012
For us*
we're currently on the revolution arc
mmmmmmmmmmmm pride month
racism homophobia transphobia and more
plus the racist gays are gonna come out to paly woO
You make it sound like a value deal
Oh god
RACISM HOMOPHOBIA TRANSPHOBIA
But wait there more
there's already some stuff about lgbtqia+ accounts getting harassed and doxxed
WITH EVERY PURCHASE OF THE KAREN YOU GET A FREE TOY
reminder that the first pride was a riot lol
This is going to sound real bad, but imagine a confederate flag but as a rainbow. That was the first imagine that came to mind with racist gays
The racist guys love the confederate flag tho
Its ‚Äúwhite culture‚Äù
The only white culture i like is yogurt
Not guys Wilson
Oh
Gays
My bad

Read that wrong
Ew wtf
<:PEPESCREAM:466446495747670027>
Omg it exists
üòÇüòÇ
Wtf
I mean of course it exists it‚Äôs the internet
Ask and you shall receive
this is a thing
Hey can we uhh talk about something less depressing? Whats everyone doing today?
But I feel like most protests and movements have been turned violent, not by the people speaking their cause but by those trying to silence them
^
Its a mix bag
Sorry sorry state of the news today, we had one good thing yesterday and that‚Äôs about it
theres always going to be a selection of people just looting for the sake of looting
Yeah
and tkaing advantage of the current state
Yes the government never respected the right to assemble
but from what i can tell the police are more likely to have intigated the violence insteadof the other way around
Even if they say they do
Many people said lets go to beverly just to riot and loot
Scawey
There are people saying it‚Äôs ‚Äúprotestors‚Äù from out of state inciting the violence
<@!173261056225837056> the cops would use TEAR GAS to control crowds during an INFECTIOUS LUNG PANDEMIC
Its insane
I hope it gets better i dont want the protests to be shut down like this
Some may be home grown too though
yeah
Yeah tear gas rn is kinda be used willy nilly
the beverly hills protest
was fucking peaceful
and then the cops changed that too
Police have way too much power rn and thats the problem
Plus theyre sending in National Guard too
they did
I mean they could get the fire hoses that literally are strong enough to tear skin, or they could let people gather and arrest the people that want to destroy their message
the only news i see for beverly hills is literally just the protestors looting
but nothing is ever said that the police started shit
Trumps take ‚ÄúIf the people get looting our people will start shooting‚Äù or something along those lines
Is there evidence of that rn :0
Scawey
they're at least admitting it was peaceful at first
Video footage is hard to find rn
Yikes
Police pls
A lot of twitter is showing the peaceful footage before
^
Yeah
la mesa was peaceful
the shop owners were outside cheering them on
And the violence incited after
and then the police came and said fuck y'all
wussup i made it out
yay dino!!
ayyyy nice
stay safe
how was it?
Woo
I can‚Äôt say news networks are completely invalidated, but if they cannot fear monger then they don‚Äôt tend to show it
honestly it was peaceful until the popo arrived
but they called it an unlawful assembly bc people started blocking the streets
which i mean yeah
ITS NOT UNLAWFUL ASSEMBLY <:PEPESCREAM:466446495747670027>
You know if they started showing up in their regular uniforms and not riot gear maybe it would cause a lot less tension
ITS CIVIL UNREST
Unlawful assembly is big cop out
Tell that to the protestors of covid-19 blocking nurses from getting to work
Oh wait
Reeee
This is such a shit show
This is America
Our administration isnt helping at all either
Yeah ik
lmao our administration is more focused on making sure trump is getting birthday messages
> We are literally living in another civil rights movement, not to gain the rights but to protect and to have the rights of black people and all people of color their rights to actually be enforced and protected
<@!213151486434082817> !!!!
Yesh
That was the answer i was looking for
> <@!186009830484344843> gonna second this one ya
<@!245736329382461440> gay rights literally exist bc of stonewall
wait you got that ad too <:pepeLMAO:490384254534942720>
Thonk
i saw it and was like donald trump doesnt deserve anything from me
Yep
ive gotten that ad like five different times already
What in the actual fuck
wait what ad
the fuck
> Fsecond
i got it once and i clicked the info thing and i was like
holy shit i‚Äôm so pissed off about the current admins. i just hope the people who weren‚Äôt able to vote four years ago but can vote now can come out and help get the orange out of office
admins as in
administration
"stop showing this to me because it's irrelevant"
not this server admins
Sad to say that the popular vote even if by a small margin didn‚Äôt vote for trump
wait i just realized
nvm
carry on
?
wha
doesn‚Äôt the electoral college need to be looked at too
iirc
like
absolutely
something something flawed
> The biggest changes and reform unfortunately was brought by violence
<@!186009830484344843> oh oop meant to reply to this but ya
But our broken as shit electoral college that over represents the minority gave him the vote
the electoral college is a twisted shitshow
<:uwu:468918270775263242>
yeah did yall see that map
let me find it
electoral college was first established because the old farts didn't trust the public to make decisions

this one
what is what a map of??
Counties voting
ahhhh
for 2016 election yeah
mid america be slackin
LMAO
theres no one there to begin with
The red are all the counties that got more representation
^
Lol Midwest is practically empty
but its like yeah sure a larger area is red but a lot more volume is blue
No one wants their home destroyed by a tornado
same energy as drowning 5 people by putting the mediterranean in australia
mid america is yee haw
<:thonk:440231969796784128>
grapes of wrath lookin asses
No it ain‚Äôt
Yee haw is Texas
Hahaha
<:GotGrapes:604860898104049664>
Kekeke
I may have hated Texas but I respect the fact they are their own thing
Basically another country
a gift

Most of middle America is basically uninhabitable
Oops wrong word
Stupid auto correct
Uninhabited
i propose that we even out the population by creating an underground city system
Independent power grid, own oil reserves, own reserve armed forces, has the flag at the same height as the US flag
Yee haw is wild
Crab people!
Maybe one day somebody will actually look at helping the Midwest
Instead of keeping em poor
Like they do with inner cities
Sam DM
Me shook
<a:monkaShoot:699841146943176734>
Yeah it‚Äôs pretty underdeveloped whenever you got out there
It‚Äôs like 1 major city then nothing
You say that like it's a bad thing
Okay maybe I worded that wrong
Don‚Äôt really know how to word it better either
i remember reading that like year one of trump being in he somehow hurt the midwestern farmers with some tariffs
talk about leopards eating ur face off
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
Trump is not in it for the laborers
And that‚Äôs all I can say about that
Trump tariffs did fuck farmers, but then he bailed them out
And by them I mean the rich ones
oh okay
OH OKAY
jesus
til about the latter part
It‚Äôs common practice in the Midwest to fuck the little guy
The ones controlled by the monopolies
Job rates in those areas are in sharp decline
üò¶
No plans for retraining
Just constant drama on *we will get your jobs back*
Or
*look who took your jobs*
The reality is the US didn‚Äôt prepare these areas for the global economy
And the post-industrial era
Cynics say it is exclusively to drum up votes
But that applies to the democratic policies for inner cities
Give with one hand and take with the other
It's cause some genius in washington back in the 90s decided that the united states was gonna have an "information economy" and that we didn't need manufacturing
so we shipped all those jobs to china
and now middle america is fucked
and they will continue to be fucked
as they have been for the past 3 decades
Thing is that could have worked if they put in place technical schools and training
Like Germany did
hell, closer to 5
When they enacted similar policies
But in essence
Yes
What you said
Instead they left middle America to rot
The thing is, it's such a stupid move
so out of touch
There's nothing wrong with working a manufacturing job
It was the smart move for the economy, but they weren‚Äôt willing to actually invest in making it work
Shit move for the people
The smart move would have been to evolve to more modern manufacturing
Which even *china* has done
Since
As they export industrial era manufacturing to other countries now
>united states
>smart move
things that make you go hmm...
<:monkahmm:716517873161601104>
<:kek:490008924414803968>
why didn't my parents choose to immigrate to canada
the united states just feels like this stupid fuckin experiment into how far we can take human greed before society collapses
what is 2020
<@!123253336198742016> is it maybe because the US represents the promise of opportunity and freedom to be ones self? 

TLDR: your parents got scammed
But still tho we are pretty fortunate to be able to enjoy the privelages we DO have in this country
Even if things are p fucked up atm
My dad‚Äôs brothers immigrated to Canada but my dad immigrated to the US because of the navy <:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
oh yea I mean I know why my parents picked america lmao
But canada has a massive Chinese population too due to hk going back to china in the 90s
it do be like that Lara :(
I could have been a canadian <:PepeHands:465022934281486346>
Ohhhhhh canadaaAaaaaaaa

F
yea dude
:/
im just very grateful
our community
hasn't stirred up some shit
there was one at ucsd
but
la jolla boomer pop
so
probably not much besides the pocket of people at ucsd
yeah
I told my brother that
and it wouldn't even matter because there's no one to see it there
no students at sd
and even if there are they're in the dorms/off campus
<a:hahakek:676470025317777484>
yuh but downtown was peaceful today
mostly
then police came
these live streams of people in protest areas are crazy
like jesus fucking christ though, i understand protest, but it's like they also forgot about covid, and the not protesters aka looters
<a:PEPEHELL2:695431293541941276>
it's mainly the latter latter
ridiculous year
<a:FeelsSuperWeirdMan:532325255721517059>
Fuck 2020
Hello i'd like to return my copy of 2020 its not  what i thought it'd be
^
<a:PEPEHELL2:695431293541941276>
These kids out making me wanna go full yee haw
i hope the 2021 release is better
the looters are pissing me off
I loved where I lived in SF
They ruined it
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
It was just a cute place
<:FeelsBadMan:441463646124507136>
i can tolerate the violence against police buildings etc, but <a:PEPEHELL2:695431293541941276> quit destroying businesses, you know damn well we live in a corporate ass country
new years finna be 13/1/2020
<:curserat:642191598259798043>
And houses now too
Heck they are close to getting into federal buildings
Where they will then all get shot
Or face federal charges
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
They have the real armed forces on those buildings, because its the only ones where they can
And apparently if you are a federal security guard you just get killed
at this point is it even blm protesters and not just randos
<:sweat:713285695694831647>
im all for violent protest if needed but whoever the looters are
they needa go
<:cursecat:612044490307272727>
Where I lived in SF is zero protesting
Just rioting
Not a single sign
its mainly randoms, and people trying to incite this shit
^
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
Anarchists, antifa, violent arms of BLM, some right wing groups
protestors and people actually fighting the cause aren't trying to harm small businesses
Usual shit
yep
we love extremists from both sides
i mean
This country makes me wanna go home
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
ppl gonna take advantages when it's out there
this country make me wanna leave
At least we know when protesters are fake
And just throw the whole kitchen sink at them
**be practicing that 1st amendment**
hell this country makes me wanna go home to my country that isn't even my native country at this point since im a basic english bitch
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
im tired
i cant think straight
the problem is whether the uneducated masses can tell the differene
they can't
I hated Texas but these small businesses need stand your ground
they all clump rioters/looters as protesters
and there will ppl who will make sure the masses cant
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
One guy who tried to defend his shop that we know of is in a coma
an asian jewelry store was shooting bang bang bangs are looters
So thats nice
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
In yee haw there was this old 70-80 something black lady
Who pulled a shotgun on 'em
Needless to say folks ran
i'd pull a miss fortune and ult the looters all
good on her
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
Don't fuck with Texan liquor stores lmao
LOL
The laws are real strict on liquor in Texas
never EVER mess with liquor stores in general
So they are generally armed
Heck, even Specs (chain store) has an armed guard

How long before someone Mustangs a crowd
<@!314229461396488195>
Oh wait it already happened
Once by accident and once on purpose
i've been pinged
yes
and yes
i love protesters 100%, looters can die
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>

looters are just angrys taking away from the value of protest
Whatever happens they ain't touching my BMW
Or it'll be touching them

<:pepeOK:490384227729408000>
<:sweat:713285695694831647>  damn opportunists
those white people looting
but u cant stop them
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
Honestly the diversity is amazing
yeah it's not even the minorities looting it looks all like white people to me
If it were anything else I'd be genuinely impressed
in the videos
Its literally *everyone*
Its hilarious
Mostly young folks
they just want those vans that were on sale months ago but they forgot to buy
I'd say about 60% or so african american in a lot of areas, but thats mostly the demographics
<:kek:490008924414803968>
Rather than any particular majority of the population being involved
Deeeffinitely a fair few white folks in California though
WTF
someone broke into a mall and smashed in a mercedes coupe on display <@!181482518107783168>
<:peepoCryTeddy:471244526556807169>
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
Sounds about right

So spicy
ok tbh i find that more hilarious than disgraceful idk
I was laughing at the shear diversity in the looters earlier
Props for Houston keeping things peaceful
We had some angry folks, but the police are just walking with them now
That said, night has fallen

this is aobut to be my bmw
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>

<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>

wilson from castaway lmao
the volleyball
oh i thought you were talking about wilson
<:sweat:713285695694831647>
LOL
Same for a sec
LMAO LARA
but also yikes
I really dont support looting
^
looters are not protesters as far as im aware
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
they say not all cops well i say not all protestors
hi biggo
issa wild dino
agree
those people think this is an opportunity to take shit
<a:COGGERS:588215562786832384>
also the police sirens are escalating around my area
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
lara do you hear them
As I said in the other channel, I've been watching people try and pay people to riot
For a few days now
On streams
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
sam i need a garage
f10 needs safety
I wish I had space
Worst comes to worst
My apartment
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
your del mar one??
Torrey Gardens
They'll never get to that
But they might get to Del Mar
oh
They threatened to
People here would fight back though
This area is uhhhh
Maybe 60% older asian, 40% older white
(my area specifically, not Del Mar as a whole)
The view of the rioters here is *very* negative
i just want all of this to end
<:pepehands:464568955533524992>
Guess if these kids want a real revolution it'll be time to pick a side
<a:PepePopcorn:554328145344462848>
i woke up 5 min ago and the first thing i thought was "wow wouldn't it be nice if my brain were to shut down for good"
i feel extremely compassion-fatigued rn
<:sadBoi:663441916465119285>
I know that feeling
I took a break from this discord a couple days ago
for like 2 days
because I was feeling so down
and didn't wanna accidently hurt someone emotionally or bring them down
take your time
my ability to sympathize/empathize with people has significantly declined since the start of quarantine
I think as we stop communicating w/ people as frequently we just start losing these social skills
<:FeelsBadMan:441463646124507136>
definitely
i've noticed I haven't been able to communicate my happy feelings with people
because its too clouded with uncertainty
and sadness from quarantine
i facetimed my friend earlier and i haven't talked to her ever since quarantine happened
<:peepocry:640363747990306827>
<:pepecry:712987584976125952>
Stay strong friends <:PepeHeart:567839212557172737>
ty chrisso
Im like kinda introverted n not that emotional id like to say so im just kinda like watever like i havent rly been clouded by negative emotions personally but like
chris my child
Idk i just feel like im losing my social skills
stoof i miss you <:pepekms:712984803678486579>
And im like will i be able to adapt to society once i come back <:FeelsBadMan:441463646124507136>
quarantine gets so hard as it keeps getting extended
or will my introvertedness take over <:FeelsBadMan:441463646124507136>
it probably wont end anytime soon
personally i got really happy at ucsd cause i made so many good friends
yup
and getting my first year cut short
same same
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
and not being close to anyone back home
makes it so hard
Not much changed for me
I had just begun being more social
and extroverted
and then all of a sudden
I highkey would have rathered getting my first yr cut short than my second yr KEK
bam
qurantine
yeah i know what you mean
and im like fook
man
I just moved from living with one person back to family
just as I was getting confident in myself
you come in  like no you can't see friends
and be social
yeah i feel that <:pepecry:712987584976125952>
im just holding on and trying to be on discord as much as possible now
i dont use words irl anymore
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
Must have sucked
lowkey i feel kinda bad for all the extroverts
bout to start using emotes irl
<:Pepesad:601573092992745472>

Deathadder gang

G502 and Deathadder are the ogs
I've had 3 Deathadders
I have a overwatch chroma one
i like the 402
the first one, the 3G, and a chroma

And I'm terrible at shooters
Mouse collectors be like
Sensei is also a classic choice
Or a Rival
stonks
ok i need a new body, soul and everything
i just lost all the will to work
i just use a regular usb mouse that was like 10$
and i have shit due
yall wack
Why buy a gaming mouse
When you can buy 3 custom keycaps
y buy a gaming mouse if ur gna lose at the game anyways
wait i want a custom key cap
i bought my gaming mouse cause it was ergonomic
<a:hahakek:676470025317777484>
lmao shih wen
I bought another G502 because it was cheaper than buying another deathadder
<:kek:490008924414803968>
Maybe 2 if you get super dupper cool ones
but i only have a laptop üò¶
i want my keyboard to come in üò≠
This G502 Hero was 39$
What laptop though
I would buy one with a lil sloth I side

<@!252670263848599563> have you tried good keyboards tho? üëÄ
i like the tippy tap
andrew's laptop was kinda flexible
The clack clack is missing
like a person doing the splits
lmao
YA
CLACK CLACK
i dont use my laptop for things other than internet tbh
clack clack
and occasional mc
Best keyboard i've ever had was an ancient dell mechanical 15 years ago
I have, wasn't super pleased
clack
the sound of the clack clack is everything
I like the short keys
i kinda need a laptop with more ram even though 8gb doesn't really seem to be slowing me down
If I bring my desktop
maybe i just need a quad core
<:thonk:440231969796784128>
I just need faster RAM
I'ma need to get silencers or a new keyboard
quad core isn't standard?
New MacBook keyboard has a nice clack clack
im living in 2017
My 3200mhz RAM is throttling infinity fabric
i need to get the new macbook pro
<a:pepeLaugh:663444889798705169>

wtf brianna
My desktop has a 2008 cpu üòî
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
But it just doesnt provide the same clack clack
Gangshit
Bc of its lack of depth
With a 1070
I need a real laptop

It‚Äôs a scissor keyboard though
If u take over ur common area

I had a roommate this year that did that
Wat Are Scissor Keyboards
I hated him
LMAOOO
y
before the bad macobok keyboard
Can't get a Macbook because I actually use touch screens, can't get another XPS 15 because Dell put in a 300 cycle battery
nows ur chance to be that roommate
snadu
Finna catch a fade with me
Like Apple used to
in all serious dont be that roommate
<:pepehmm:520539005477978123>
i need to search up a pic
apple reverted back to their old keyboard
basically
^
Its identical in design
They actually listened for once
He was so dirty
i took over my common area this yr bc my roommate was super sensitive and slept at midnight and woke up at noon
And kinda racist to me when we first met
oh
Anyone with creativity is long gone from Apple
they also made it thiccer again for a slightly bigger batteyr

In the other room
Lmao imagine talking to your roommates

Wtf now my lamp is spazzing out
F

my first year wack asf my second yr was relatively chill
<:thonk:440231969796784128>
My suite mates avoided making eye contact with me

What do you mean Wilson
james y
for a desktop
watd u do to them
you can have the biggest psu you want
my power supply
Idk

Maybe there's a limit I have no power now anymore wtf
They were just like that
Unless you are me pre GTX 1080
We didn‚Äôt talk much
o
Who was near the limit of my old AX 1200
<a:ohohoho:636686946734964786>
I got an apt this year
what hte avoided contact
in warren?
Constantly ran it near 1150W
At least only 1 guy was dirty
nah bc i wanted to get a 750w seasonic but they only have the 850w available
F
and theyre about the same price
Yeah I was in Douglas
everyone in my apartment was clean
<a:pepeLaugh:663444889798705169>
Just get the 850
chris i think
edward

Rather than like 4/15 being dirty in a suite
of my apartment
You might need it who knows
on snapchat
Your apt was so clean

LMAO
Intels CPUs eat stupid power and are terrible
OMFG
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>

We LIVED IN THE SLUMS
all of us in the apartment were just very clean
<a:ohohoho:636686946734964786>
My 3900X tops out at about 210W
i HATE HATE HATE ppl who do not do their dishes for a whole week
always cleaned up after ourselves
Seemingly
paradise
<:monkaGIGA:585569750281748481>
we all cleaned our dishes RIGHT AFTER using them
<a:ohohoho:636686946734964786>
no dleya
delya
delay
inglish
In my apartment we rinsed and left them for a week or two
my apt would be too high to do dishes
xinglish
damn it
Then just used our dishwasher
so it usually fell on me as the only sober one
<:ahah:567191707079409705>
Part of our ceiling fell off
:' )
wtf
ok ok i actually need to disappear
<:Pepescream:478988294106120194>
Halfway through winter

Don't do it
Dry wall all over the bathroom and shower

That was an F
how long did it take to get fixed o.o
It happened like w3? And it was "fixed" just before finals week iirc
When we left we could see the ceiling start to look bad again so I wouldn't be surprised if it falls again lol
so did u guys just like
not shower for 6 weeks
<:yeet:442868651792793601>
did yall not
Call hdh
We called them right away lol
No we didn't shower
We just used a lil dish soap before we had to go out tbh
<:yeet:442868651792793601>
Got the job done
i-
Had to keep the engineering tradition alive
that is
Ya know
I-
i mean
exceeding expectations
u know there r buildings on campus w showers right
gotta give credit where its due
Nah it's chill we decided it was better to study
i-
Also we usually got a nice spot in Geisel
People just seemed to clear out whenever we chose somewhere to sit
It was really nice
<:yeet:442868651792793601>
<:monkaS:442185930867081218>
I cant tell if ur joking or srs
n it scares me
LMAOOO
Nah bro we could still shower haha
ok bc there r some ppl who deadass smell like they do thay
in some of the cse classes i been in
We couldn't shower for like 3 hours when hdh came to fix
and my suitemate first yr would rinse only
<:FeelsBadMan:441463646124507136>
But it was in the middle of the day who cares
no soap
Yikesssssss
I copped a loofa
Best purchase ever I even got it pink
i dont like loofas theyre kinda itchy
pink is the manliest color change my mind
I can't
I don't want to
pink was originally a masculine color no?
then hitler changed it or some shit like that
idr the story
But yeah for like 5 weeks we had a big ass dehumidifier in our restroom so the drywall could settle and we could still shower with hot water
So ghetto
damn hdh rly said fuck u
we love hdh
Tape over the cable so we wouldn't kill ourselves lol
thats a big F
hdh was pretty good my 2nd yr
we said we were missing a trash can when we moved in
Yeah our apt sucked ballllllllllzzz
And then they came 6 dif times w trash cans
And then we had 10 extra trash cans
Buuuuhdhakkdkfkals
rip marshall flooding <:pepekms:708511036411609099>
no joke the trash cans were like
6 ft apart
bc we had so much
We had a lizard sneak into our apt one day too
there was 3-4 in the common area
He got in through the window lol
By the time I got back they had thrown him out
But the way I see it
He wanted to be our pet
wait free pet
KEK
wtf
And we denied him
F
I will never forgive my apt mates
Fomies
tb to when we had 3 fish in our apt
and they all died 1 by 1
mood
I literally have no power at home still
We had 1 fish
ok well 2 were murdered but
Am I Amish now or what
Think its still alive

WAIT QUESTION
is anyone else getting ‚Äúaction blocked‚Äù messages from instagram

what were you trying to do?
like before rhat it was EVEN MORE
i was pressing on the comment section of a post
but it was BLM related and the action blocked is happening everytime i‚Äôm doing something BLM related LOL
tinfoil hat time
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
also is it possible to get shadowbanned on instagram <:wsVsU7mxSU2FdfU5NtpgQA_thumb_470:688600982212706336>
the mind police are here to censor you
stop ur scaring me !
<a:sadshakeoffthetears:699396332183486494>
lol I kid
i think someone may have reported you or something like that but dw it should subside by tomorrow or something
that emote LOL
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
if someone reported me im throwing hands
<:pain2:706947574732423188>
They are probably trying to moderate info so nothing crashes
<a:catmemeendsyou:632629976449024061>
I can only imagine the strain their systems are under
It‚Äôs not built for the kind of live posting it‚Äôs being used for
That said they can shadowban if enough people report you I believe
BRU
Heated times folks
I wish you Americans well

covid came through and said no no no
you thought
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
other way around?
wat
you mean by other way around
idk i thought covid would force most ppl off campus
rather than on
oh, nah cause some people wont even come during fall
i think the people i was gonna live with wont come during fall
who do they b
it be
caitlin, xinchen, uh zoey, then aaron,
the gorls were gonna room together
but yeah covid struck through and put a blockade
on everything
<a:hahakek:676470025317777484>
covid said u can‚Äôt have cait
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
cuz they know she‚Äôs mine

<:birb:636686833002217492> <:birb:636686833002217492> <:birb:636686833002217492>
she was gonna be homeless
i would never let that happen
kevin swapped his spot out for caitlin
i‚Äôd move my mans out
and have her come
well now you wont
just take caitlin
<a:hahakek:676470025317777484>

<a:hahakek:676470025317777484>
i guess kevin can come back now
but yeah housing plans for everyone is all messed up now
very glad i took the option of signing my housing contract
<:shook:606018427018149889>

signing it
i would love to booty booty w ur bf

<:yeahnina:713286883257352223> <:yeahnina:713286883257352223> <:yeahnina:713286883257352223> <:yeahnina:713286883257352223> <:yeahnina:713286883257352223> <:yeahnina:713286883257352223> <:yeahnina:713286883257352223> <:yeahnina:713286883257352223> <:yeahnina:713286883257352223> <:yeahnina:713286883257352223> <:yeahnina:713286883257352223>
there you have it joanne
we have to set them up to an ass fight
it is written
must happen by law
and i have a 4 year housing guarantee vs other people
cause remember scholarship
wow don‚Äôt hurt us like this
F
ucsd looked me up and down and said fuck this dumb bitch
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
not a penny from ucsd
F
<:pepehands:464568955533524992>
i was granted it because ucsd had a relationship with my highschool
i guess they thought my dad had my back
one of the few high schools in SD
theh didn‚Äôt know my dad is broke af
<:pepehands:464568955533524992>
oof
esp now that his store got broken into
oh shit
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
the raids?
the raids
<:peepoCryTeddy:471244526556807169>
ya some looters
does he have insurance?
ya
you can always appeal for more financial aid joanne
ok that's good
it‚Äôll be fine
i know alex appealed like 3 times
how long do you have to appeal
caitlin appeal for financial aid sounds like loans
<:shook:606018427018149889>
:0 i kinda wanted to finish finals first
yeah it does
depends on what you're looking for
alex appealed for loan <a:poggerspls:585808456842215424>
cuz i also appealed and got more grant
WHAT THE
why is alex offline
<:cursecat:612044490307272727>
hes asleep
is he actualyl dead
NANI
<:nandatto:579878642537201665>
also tyty matt for letting me in
alex sleeps?
although idk whats gonna happen with the country in this condition
yeah caitlin you would've been granted accessed but i think
our housing fell apart
our housing plans anyways
it just shattered
yea is fine
covid out here
i dont really want to pay for fall either so i asked kevin about it
giraffe kevin?
ye i dont think xinchen is coming back for fall?
not sure
or she might
giraffe kevin
because i think she said she had a in class
class
F
he said depends if she gets into the galbraith hall one
she might be forced back
and zoey have no idea
when you say don‚Äôt come back, do you mean they‚Äôre just doing remote?
they're doing half remote
half online
galbraith hall sounds really intimidating, whatever it is
or uh mostly remote
some in class
this whole thing just kinda blows
i was looking forward to living in a cute la jolla apartment
^
i just want to not be at home
and having access to my vehicle at all times
like ucsd on a regular quarter deprived me of that and my car is my personality
as you all know
<a:hahakek:676470025317777484>
i barely have my car at ucsd right now if i can find parking on justice lane in warren
show us a car pic
with it's like 20 spots of parking
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
justice lane?
coming up
your car
my mom drove down to shihwens apartment
i saw stuff about ucsd parking being ass
and just parked wherever
LOL

i mean i still have my apartment at ucsd
so i have to park
and keep it stagnant
when i do stay
yeah true
<:pepehands:464568955533524992>
sometimes i get good parking other times i dont
justice lane is disgusting
and where did joanne go she requested a car pic
<a:hahakek:676470025317777484>
wow the angle on that pic
yeah it was a weird angle
i went to kill my eyes
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
i clicked nina‚Äôs spotify link
and it went full white
on my eyes
LOL
i just wanted to enlarge the photo
F
matt is still listening to twice
icu
üëÄ
<:aha:612044524927057921>
twice always
<a:ohohoho:636686946734964786>
i like cheer up a lot still
mina‚Äôs line gives me chills
<:PatrickWeary:579976188487794699>
i should really go back to the older ones
beautiful classics
but i hated their actual cheer uniforms
i learned the dance for cheer up at some point
the special outfits were super cool
loved the mv concept
^
yesss

"no pressure, but I want you to go out there and set the world on fire"

how do you guys feel abt gifts for a kid doing badly in school, make the gift seem like a reward for doing well or give them a seasonal gift regardless?
people get seasonal gifts?
yeah
a... seasonal gift?
yall get gifts?
i just get *beat*
^^^
preach
but in all seriousness can you pls elaborate on what you mean by seasonal gift? and the context of this situation? (if you feel comfortable)
depends on
their age imo
i wouldn't give a young kid a gift saying it's a reward for doing well if they're doing badly
imagine not getting yelled at by your parentals every day üôÇ
imagine them not looking over your shoulder everyday to see what youre doing
<@!446932571192819713>  sounds too good to be true
yeah ill elaborate, my younger brother is 11yo and I bought him a 144hz monitor since I myself never grew up with one and always wanted one when I was younger, so I knew how appreciative he would be when he got older, 
but he's not doing very well in school so im not sure if it's appropiate to give him a gift when all he does is play videogames and not schoolwork
he's in 5th grade so like, it's really hard to judge his performance anyways
<:wotthink:441465363671154698>
Honestly it‚Äôs quite typical for younger kids to just play games all day every day nowadays
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
i was only allowed to play video games on weekends when i was a kid D:
^ yep
id say if anything try to use it as motivation to do better in school
^
rather than just like
ope here ya go
i hate it but it was probably for the best
but i was only rewarded when i did well in school
same jenny/tomer
understandable
"rewarded"
"here you get a burger today"
üôÇ
~~given food and not yelled at~~
^^^
LOL
EXACTLY
damn i never even had a pc till i was like 13
looking back, "wow basic necessities and mental health" yay
we had an old ass dell family computer lol
miniclip was fire though
lmao same but it was a laptop
<@!580246928596664321> yeah I grew up like that too, playing videogames every day and being shocked when some of my friends said they could only play on the weekends, the only difference was that I still did all my hw/stuff first
we had this hella old dell laptop and i think all i played on it was solitare and minesweeper
tfw you still dont have a 144hz monitor <:pepehands:464568955533524992>
D:
christian
when you make big bucks with your comp eng degree
dw
you'll have **3** 144 hz monitors üôÇ
don't forget me tho üò†
240hz*
i have 2 monitors
buy yourself a 144hz monitor rn üôÇ
if you forget me christian, you'll actually be dead üò†
neither is above 60
but issok
quantity over quality rn
üëç
one day, buddy
<:wotthink:441465363671154698>
<@!173286369026637824> valorant
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
honestly that reminds me of when my parents used to restrict me only 2 hrs of pc everyday
today
rip aedan
it be like that
mayhaps
if i get my work done early
but that restriction went away after i got my pc
doubtful but maybe
<:pepeOK:490384227729408000>
but thats high school
join us for in house valorant, christian
LOL mood my parents restricted my gaming based on my test scores
valorant in house*?
A- on a test/quiz = x amt of hrs
i would wish for a console like every new years
ah i was just expected to get good grades
never got one lol
D:
santa ain't real
who hurt u jenny
yes
damn my parents never paid too much attention in my school work
since we came to the sttes
<:peepocry:640363747990306827>
but that didnt mean i just slack off tho <:peepocry:640363747990306827>
but <@!84197211113533440> id say give it to him but expect something to come from it too
when u ask for a pokemon game and you get a pokemon booster pack from santa
oof
like a increased focus in school or maybe he gets more interested in pc's and starts learning that way
for me 
one way to maintain focus even when i can play games whenever is that i tend to play games that makes me feel interested
cough* **RTS games** cough*
factorio
man i still remember playing RoTK and Nobunaga's Ambition games
<:pepeOK:490384227729408000>
one of the earliest online games i played was this top down shooter
i can't really remember what it was called but it was like red vs blue
**armor games**
<@!173286369026637824> truee, hm it's about to be summer for him next monday so i cant really ask for him to study/do work in the summer.. ill do what you said and say it's on his promise that he'll do good in the future
i used to grind kongregate
and there were game modes like king of the hill
and rotmg
> <@!173286369026637824> truee, hm it's about to be summer for him next monday so i cant really ask for him to study/do work in the summer.. ill do what you said and say it's on his promise that he'll do good in the future

<:peepocry:640363747990306827>  life was easier back then
<:peepocry:640363747990306827>
I still play BTD6
yeah as long as hes learning new stuff it doesnt have to be schoolwork
<:peepocry:640363747990306827>
my first introduction to tactic optimization
i couldnt game properly till i built my pc
_aggresively trynna stack towers_
<:kek:490008924414803968>
> yeah as long as hes learning new stuff it doesnt have to be schoolwork
<@!173286369026637824> maybe you can do something like a little project that gets him interested?
if it looks cool it might work
<:hypers:471374617337135134>
so i sorta taught myself linux and installed ubuntu on the family pc so it wouldnt be so process intensive lol
i still suck at it and it didnt really work out
but at least i tried and learned something out of it
> i still suck at it and it didnt really work out
this right here is my entire cs career

oh wait forgot but
good morning guys
Thirty fucking two percent. I give up from this school, I really do.

All that fucking hard work for nothing. The overall experience is absolute trash but I thought, maybe, the reputation would save it but just look at that shit. 1 in 3. What the fuck. That's middle america tier. Just let anyone in! Worked hard? Come on in! Did you work just a bit more than usual? Come on in!

I got fucking regents, they bought me the fuck out, but fuck this I should have gone to USC or UCLA and just take the L on the debt. All the sacrifices I made for prestige and money: working extremely hard for 1530 SAT, giving up social life, giving up a dream school atmosphere and experience all for fucking nothing, all absolutely out the fucking window. When anyone can get in like this what's the point in working so hard to pull yourself out of the herd? Any fucking dumbass can make it in here. I am fucking done with this place.

I'm going to be obsessed just to get post-graduate work so I can erase this embarrassment from my life.

If this was your "target" school and you made it in, congrats, but just to let you know as you have realized: you're not very ambitious and you settled for very little.
make that trigger
when you type ucsd
oh my
good idea
LOL
china
FUCK YEAH
and oops sorry for spam

aight i am done with spam

why is this emote called ucsd
wait did you delete jof
no
triton bot has
oH
limited functionality for custom reactions
what that mean
i am five years old in cs terms
fprintf('Hello World')
basically
triton bot scans each message
and checks if the message is literally only "ucsd"
moon god on the other hand i think just checks if test is in a specific message
so if i talk about testing enough
what about whitespace
it will eventually pop up
ucsd
whitespace gets ignored ig
ahhhhh
if message is 'ucsd':
ufck
i can't
tye
yea something like that lara
ucsd
just type better
it works when ucsd is socially distancing
icic
ucsd
yea
i think discord just cuts whitespace
<@!334441828512432129>  i think discord automatically removes whitespacing

the amount of entitlement in fucking ppl sometimes man i swear
its enough to really wanna make you strangle them sometimes
like just grab him by the neck and whisper to him you dont deserve to breathe this fucking air
you literal piece of shit
and watching him suffocate
it's best to just not take it seriously, you know
while you're here complaining about 32 percent there are ppl who wish they had the opportunity of higher education
yea but it was a real post
by a real person
i know it was real
always some wack ass peeps u know
don't let them get to u
true true
not that i would ever do that lol
but i would certainly like to sometimes
violence is never condoned even if you hate the opposing view or person <@!219584106550263809>
i know you're exaggerating but remember that this is a public discord
and some people may feel uncomfortable with violent remarks
yea ok got a bit heated there
i just cant stand these kinds of people
its quite understandable
please keep what I said in mind tho, this goes to everyone especially during these trying times
yes of course
if it were up to me tho id kick this guy out of ucsd and have him blacklisted from every university in the country
and let him back on the one condition that he make a public apology to the entire university
and then say sike you didnt want to come here anyway lmaooo
and then let him back in fr because im not a monster
learn some humility fool
i wouldnt do that because at the end of it all, he worked to get into this school and people should not be attacked by threat of expulsion for their words
Anger is understandable, but especially in these times violence is 100% not the answer. Even if you mean it as a joke or lightheartedly, etc.
you can be mad at that but that doesnt mean you should get kicked out
Also, remember that we have said things when we were younger that we don't believe anymore
A lot of people change their views when they grow up
I remember being someone who used to care about ranks more than anything
Now, no
> i wouldnt do that because at the end of it all, he worked to get into this school and people should not be attacked by threat of expulsion for their words
<@!181933280487014402>  he also got in because of privilege. I guarantee you many more ppl worked much harder than him and didnt get shit.
<@!219584106550263809> please check your dms
> he also got in because of privilege. I guarantee you many more ppl worked much harder than him and didnt get shit.
and less, too
You don‚Äôt know how hard he worked from his statement, you just know that he cares a lot about exclusivity
> <@!181933280487014402>  he also got in because of privilege. I guarantee you many more ppl worked much harder than him and didnt get shit.
<@!219584106550263809> i mean thats why the school is so diverse. If you think about it, if the school admitted a bunch of students who put in the same effort, out athletic team wouldnt be as good as it is now, out education field would not be as diverse as it is now, theres a lot of reasons why the school accpets people regardless of the effort they put in
(I'm very conscious of the fact that I got into UCSD simultaneously without trying, and as a fluke.)
(Fluke, because my HS GPA unweighted is well below mean.)
my hs made it easy for us <:FeelsBadMan:441463646124507136>
(Still haven't resolved the underlying issues.)

i really dont understand what you mean by privilege, wilson, but imo everyone has a different experience with admissions. i know some people who feel like theyre below "average" in terms of numbers, i know people who are probably above "average", and theres people like me, who think they're sitting right around where they belong
anyway
MOON GOD HAS FRIENDS?????
by all rights, I *probably* shouldn't have gotten in to UCSD
yeah and we all come from different backgrounds
especially given priors of background
*sigh*

does anyone know "ucsd tomphamdinh" on val/league
nope
nope
n
nope
but i found his op.gg
interesting
he's in my game xd
is he good?
idk
tomphamdinh looks familiar in valorant
only one round so far
but i never seen it with the ucsd
it looks like he's a big lol player
prolly another way to say tom hampton?
no
its viet
oh
yea i think that makes alot more sense than tom hampton tbh
> prolly another way to say tom hampton?
<@144994874570047488> jef u got me fuckin ROLLING
I JUST
I ADORE UR TRAIN OF THOUGHT
TOM HAMPTON
oh tomphandinh
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
tomphamdinh > tom hampton
i see it now
cannot unsee
tomppabeats
Sounded it out
:((
Pls dont roll
tht was a p good guess tho
Very bad for you
all the more rzn to do it
Mdma can fuck up your brain
Also apparently #whitelivesmatter is trending on twitter
But it's all kpod
Kpop
me looking at my depression and anxiety issues: oh really
yeah i saw it, it's a nice way to troll
kpop stans be amazin tbh
<:ohohoho:528367447472865284>
i hope it discouraged the ppl who started the hashtag from posting more
<a:ohohoho:636686946734964786>
kpop stans take no shit usually
<:aha:612044524927057921>
Oh i thot kpop stans were racist for a sec
and will overturn bullshit
if needed
Kpop stans were trying to cancel some musician the other day
Cause he used a sample of Jim Jones
im part of kpop twt and the way..... they can be weird sometimes
Never saw how that turned out
oh dear let's not talk abt bts
That was BTS they were canceling?
Yeah
Behind the scenes of movies is great
I love when they spammed the police apps with fancams
I thought they were like the biggest group
What happened
personally i don't like tht he sampled the speech bc yikes
oh ok so
james
to give context
Bruh if death grips can sample manson, BTS can sample Jim Jones
Sample whoever you want
It makes your music interesting
i get tht i just get weirded out when ppl use samples of murderers in their music
thats like the point tho?
I've just never been one to shout down artists for their creative choices
bts is undoubtedly the most well known kpop grp but they get backlash bc part of their fandom is batshit crazy and v elitist
It's like the whole satanic panic thing that metal as a genre had to put up with
it's just bullshit
ya but for me i'm not comfortable with wht yoongi from bts did but anyway
The only K-pop stan I like personally know is a bts stan
so even if bts is rlly well known, ppl sometimes resent their fans for being overzealous and condescending, bc these individuals actively tear down current and past gen kpop to uplift bts and boast of their superiority
i could never be a kpop fan simply bc i can not remember more than 3 names at a time
And theres like 12 of them in one group
o army is scary
Can confirm
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
i felt that Wendy
I cna't rememvber names
for the life of me
<:xd:612726759846051861>
I can listen to a band for 6 years
Same Shih Wen
and not know all their names
I forgot andrew for a full year
<:kek:490008924414803968>
true
wait til hear abt nct: there's 21 of em
King Gizzard has like 7 people in it, and I only know the names of like 4
bruh
i rmb going to caitlin n asking who tf kept saying hi to me otw to class
I remember my friend told me to name everyone in nct
And I did
And they were like wtf
BAHAHAHAH
that's like bigger than most of the classes were at my middleschool
stonks
i dont even have 21 friends
Imagine having 3 friends
couldn't be me
Imagine having friends
they're in subunits but in 2018 they all collabed (the 18 tht existed at the time)
yeah i listen to kpop bands, i wont remember their names
wait yall have friends?
unless they all come out one by one like loona
<a:hahakek:676470025317777484>
where do i get one of those
tbh, I'd rather have like 1 or 2 really close friends than 20+ friends

i mean like i dont mind if we have a civil conversation but at the same time me scared of confrotnation yk
like when im arguing w someone i dont think straight
You can possibly just send a message to redirect their messages to the original ig
i did i did
sucks tht you're going thru this sandy, and there's def no rush in responding to these ppl right away
if at all if they're being rude
you can educate people but dont waste your energy on educating people that wont listen
<:thonkemplating:588683802763722752>
i empathize
ahh thank you guys
and even though i would've never willingly put myself in this situation like
this is the least i can do for people that have been treated poorly their entire lives
it is the ABSOLUTE least i can do. and because of that i know that what im doing is great despite what i might have to go through
i will gladly go through it in hopes of educating others and having people understand the movement

ya know im so surprised how widespread the protests have become
<:thonk:440231969796784128>
surprised?
really ?
like with the demonstrations in other countreis across the world
oh
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
i mean
it's for racism all over
im not surprised but super happy its happening
yeah not just the US
so ppl that go "wow i hate the us" is like deflecting in a way bc racism is prevalent everywhere
US isn't only subject to racism but it is definitely a worse problem here it seems
yep
lol in the us i know it was gonna be come big but like in some nations that dont like the US like Iran is providing encouragement to the protesters
oh tru
well because they're humans too
trump: iran dont kill ur protestors
wot
us protesters: bich dafuq
yeah there was like
a tweet in january or smth
o
lemme find lemme find
<:pepehmm:520539005477978123>

proles reminds me of 1984
and the hunger games
when my body refuses to sleep
i kind of just......... cover my eyes with a pillow
i just get angry at it
relax whole body
drop shoulders
n relax
like to think im floating in an ~ocean~
also bc the receptors in ur eye dont detect light it produces more melatonin. unless u alr sleep in pitch dark or smth
I have a little eye mask
i dont like eye masks bc light still gets in from the nose area but yas
anything that just makes it like DARK. like u cant even detect light outside of closing ur eyes
I try my best to get to that level of darkness
But I'm just restless tonight it seems
F
F is right
that doesnt help snadu
i just end up adapting to see in the dark
even with all lights off
Lol same

Do you ever just drive aimlessly back and forth between school and home without ever dropping her off, for the length of the entire school day, for no other reason other than you can?

I DONT KNOW WHY OK
i think its cuz ppl r scared of making the wrong choice
^
thats how i ee it atleast
which is understandable i mo
god i cant type
i usually either suppress feelings or just do what i do then act like i didn't do what i just did
<a:pepeLaugh:663444889798705169>
I, um
Let's not go there.

<a:hahakek:676470025317777484>

shush
https://tenor.com/view/reading-sign-cant-stop-me-no-one-can-stop-me-gif-13921932
i had to suppress them bc he was in relationships
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
ok
valid
lemme tell u my sad sad story
F
we had a thing in ninth grade
I'll get the tissue box
i ended it bc i was oompa loompa dumbass bich and scared of commitment
but then we still good friends
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
then he liked my bff from swim, i set them up
This is already a very sad story.
helped him ask her to hoco
well at least you know you're not committed and end it before going deep in and
unstable
helped him break up w her
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
helped him get back tgt with her
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
helped him break up with her again
ok im scared of snadu now
playing with fire over here
<:aha:612044524927057921>
and then he got into another one year relationship that recently ended but thats where we went MIA bc like...
Queue blackpink
they were those couples that ONLY hung out w each other
so i didnt talk to him for a while
and then april hits
quarantine p bad strains relationships
he goes to me for help
it does can confirm
i help him thru it and this is like the worst i've seen him at
and then end of april they break up
and now we're here
<:feelsbadman:584486296097914911>
<:blobcatsweatsip:411231776388677633>
i am og simp
<:pepesimp:704774872924160060>

INOJGEdfs
Simps unite
fax
i like how i was not simp till college
<a:hahakek:676470025317777484>
idk like i hate to be that person that idealizes others but im afraid i won't find someone like him again <:simp1:706947938831827016>

quite silly
<:pepehmm:520539005477978123>
That's another thing I don't understand
Why people hate being idealized
him
because they bash themselves and believe they will never be good enough for anyone
and when someone does think they're awesome
they shatter
owpefjdso
hi snadu
insecurities RISE
i called you out
what r u talking abt ! def not me .
<:pepesimp:704774872924160060>
we need that emote
<a:hahakek:676470025317777484>
also anyways i think that sentiment can be built from childhood stuff <:feelsbadman:584486296097914911>
i have to yoink it

I made an Apple Pay screen for my UI after another person suggested an image
Didn‚Äôt like it
Downloaded the whole Apple resource library
Recreated the whole thing
Animations included
yup, I see where this is going
Ported it all from XD to Figma
Even the fonts
And opacity
It should even automatically update depending on what you buy
(The text, cost etc)
wow
That sounds impressive
<a:pepeFAST:650248098483929108>
I just need to build an animation for the double tap the side button bit
Ooh dawn is in half an hour I think I can make it
But that would require breaking out an animation tool
Which might happen
I‚Äôm going insane
Lol, sounds like sleep might be good for everyone here
<:FeelsExhaustedMan:622864803916152842>

I'm at a live final review for my neurology class and there's 140 slides. Oh no.
oh no
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
that's a lotta slides
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
y'all ever have so much shit to do that you don't even know where to start
I just pick one either at random or whatever one I think will get done the fasted
being able to cross things off the list, even if there's a big thing, is really relieving and pretty encouraging
<:pepeOK:490384227729408000>
okok thats what i do too but i have like 10 million tabs open <:kek:490008924414803968>
about to just yeet them all and start anew
it hurts when i have 10 million tabs open but 5 million are on one screen and 5 million are on the other screen so im twice as overwhelmed
Lol
I hate it when I have too many tabs
only time I can have a lot of tabs open is when they're all resource links when im doing a paper
i have a lot of tabs open bc i would be doing a task and then i would remember something and then go check on that
then that new thing needs like 4 more tabs
and its just an endless cycle and i would go back to the very first thing i was doing. my life is quite a mess üôÇ
relatable jenny

yep yep
chillin
want it to be summer already
but lowkey hoping fall comes soon
I miss everyone ;-;
same ://
Not much left to do for this quarter in my case
so I been keepin myself busy
Low key might just stack up on classes and graduate a year early
If fall is completely online
fancy shmancy
im taking fall easier
i really struggled with the online format
motivation is too easy to lose
Yeah I feel that
rn I have 2 ges planned for fall
I stopped goin to classes bc all the recordings were online, and I did hw in that time instead
ez clap
yep
100
&
it's a good time management method I think
if you dont fall behind then yeah
but once the lectures pile up it can be kinda dauntin
yeah
Just gotta be careful
it's been interesting tho
meh for me the lectures are even less engaging especially when the profs are having tech issues or stuff like that
been hard to follow
Oh I meant in terms of structure
I only had one live lecture this quarter so I don't have much to say there
gm gamers

Same
> i dont like taking pictures of myself
<@!173286369026637824> u gotta do it . for the ladies.
and the ones i have arent that good lol
same
But thats because im ugly
^
chris if i had ur face as a guy id be taking
chris u can do it
or i dont think so
so many
but im not like that
like selfie taking is an art, and u gotta know ur angles
it's ok if ur not into it!!
trust
ive tried and it feels so weird hahaha
Im not fat is literally the only thing i have going for me
but when ppl take photos make sure they're coming out WELL at least
aw man
the fatphobia
gtg
sad reax bc im not photogenic
i think u look nice in pics dino!!
im lowkey conscious of my weight too <a:MD:496565330240602113>
Im talking about like obese level of fat
Not like
A bit meaty
and since i lost motivation to workout and go running im just like ok I dont have to eat that much today
diana you're fucking adorable
Cuz with my lifestyle i should really be obese lul
<:sweat:713285695694831647> now that i think bout it i've gained weight since i went home
<:FeelsBadMan:441463646124507136>
i used to lost weight bac in school bcuz i just *dont eat* and study
Doesnt help when ur parents always nag on your for never being able to put on weight

this is basically me
except im skinny
asian culture is telling you you're fat and then saying you dont eat enough
Same
throwback to when my mom commented about my weight instead of saying hi after three months of not seeing each other
oh god thats literally my mom when i went bac during winter break
Asian culture is telling you how you‚Äôre not good enough and why cant you do what [insert relative kids name] is doing
i hate it when azn parents act like it's their right to comment on their kids' bodies lmao
That pciture is basically me
<a:ohohoho:636686946734964786>
/']\giphy
I'm a lazy ass piece of trash
fatshaming is so prevalent
wtf just happened
my mom says im too skinny
and then they wonder why we dont share everything with them anymore
they want us to eat and then they're like ew no ur so big
like tf.
i want outtttttt
> Asian culture is telling you how you‚Äôre not good enough and why cant you do what [insert relative kids name] is doing
<@!184791890409816065> my case wat basically the same except it's [insert some neighbor's kid]
god bless im out of here after finals
im yeeting
<a:PepePopcorn:554328145344462848>
heck yeah
Im sure almost everyone can say something sumilar
Meanwhile British parents be like, *whatever you do, don't become an American*
And thats about it
okay fax
oof
they not wrong
i mean ive only had azn parents idk how other parents from other races parent
jenny u are indeed skinny
I mean, Britain isn't much better rn... :P
but
Well actually, its more of a passive aggressive parenting where you can do whatever you want but you are also just expected to know what you can and cannot do
skinny legend
:3
my parents just always told me to work hard af
And if you break the unspoken rules you die
thats kind of how it is in my family
<:peepocry:640363747990306827> <@!303002872646467596>
the trauma tht comes from azn parenting is imo unparalled
but i think ive been scared into doing absolutely nothing
Then again other british folks in my school had parents that just didn't care and partied with them
flex is being able to ask parents for hw help growing up
Ok i think i finally can fall asleep now
But there was still always an *unspoken* expectation
I have enough depressing things to thibk about to cry myself to sleep
Good night
night!

its rare to find someone actually looking for a relationship
You better be asleep.

uh oh i got 44 likes it‚Äôs been 5 minutes

gorl power
NO NO NO ||DICK PICS||
simps be out
and creeps
What is happening
there will be some
trust
its unavoidable on that app
Imagine getting matches on tinder. Couldn't be me.
I don't get why guys think girls want to stare at their penises.
_I_ don't want to stare at my penis.
because people are horny
Some people use the app as a hookup service
most*
thats why I gave up on dating apps lmao
Go to a cafe
good on the people who found someone
ok time to delete tinder then

Hi Nathan

"IS THIS UR HYDRO?"

I GOT ON THE SCOOTER
AND YEETED
I don‚Äôt remember the first thing I‚Äôve said the jeff

i want me some boba now ugh why
*pretends to yeet it at him*
u should have
~~I only remember the creaming incident~~
the what
him: WAIT N-
I used Tinder for a little bit because I wanted a relationship and was feeling too impatient to let one happen naturally
ngl nina it was a lot of work for me to get out of bed to come claim my hydro
Needless to say I didn't get anything from it
natural relationships or bust
<@!242544930528952321> omw with boba
U WENT TO ROSES APT i thought tht was so funnie
i'll slide in ur dms w boba this time

I‚Äôve never used dating apps
im too smooth brain to understand that <@!206933072078307328>
tinder > bumble in terms of cute ppl
facts
it just means facts
oh

Unless that memey bro app counts
Tinder just has more people in general
thats just me being boomer then
But I was catfishing

o
i think you are really good looking chris
That's a great song, respect
so it's a completely different environment
ok back to the convo
300 miles radius
Nice
1000miles radius to ucsd
<a:weeHypers:716841972668563456> i started strong and then idk what happened
it do be a catchy song
i never set my radius above like......................... 15 miles
unless i was Really Bored
Imagine being good looking
but the 16 mile cuties
i caught the ugly
couldnt be me
agreed
Cant relate
smh david
<@!151123898698563584> thinks im ugly
> i never set my radius above like......................... 15 miles
<@242544930528952321> yeah i didn't like making my radius more than 50
I‚Äôm ugly as fuck
mood
social construct
I'm
Ugly is subjective
cannot relate attractiveness -> romantic relationships
you know how theres never hot singles in your area
ugly is my best subject
maybe thats because *you're the hot single*
üëÄ
Lies
aw
well at least im neither of those things
amen
I‚Äôm not a hot single
i'm just single
im bad at conversation
are you an ugly taken
yes
same
<@!151123898698563584>
Yes Nathan
Im just ugly
wait andy you're
*no*
o. o
wait
HMM
i. i can't call myself ugly anymore bc i don't believe it anymore
i only do it on my absolute worst days
<@!242544930528952321>  wat
i still believe it in somewhat but also at the same time i just say it because i want jeff to give me attention
we stan self confidence
<@!151123898698563584> im UGLY
oh also when my skin is acting up bc i hate my textured skin
t e x t u r e d
> <@!151123898698563584> im UGLY
<@242544930528952321> lie one more time i dare u
social construct tho, nobody is rly ugly
I've been stuck with acne and I kinda just hope it blends in with my freckles at this point
i am tho
LMAO
jeff what iin the fuck
maybe you'll grow out of it soon <@!175792267590762496>
acne should be more normalized along with other skin conditions
meanwhile i havent had acne all my life until now
why is everyone awake...
i fucking hate hearing ppl putting others down for their SKIN
tea methinks
> why is everyone awake...
<@151123898698563584> mind ur business jeff
period
But because some people can get rid of it, it raises the ceiling for 'beauty', which in turn raises peoples' expectations
nina where is our

Good nighto Aedan !
hello! im class of '24 and i was a little confused on how to declare a minor? i wanted to minor in computer science but i wasnt sure when/how to declare it? thank you!
<@!711817625394741359> hi! if you go onto your triton link there's an option under advising and grades that says Major & Minor, and that's where you would do it!

thank you!!!
np np it should tell you what you need to do but essentially have courses you plan to take that fulfill the minor requirements ready
and plug all that in

OO happy birthday!! <@!247048961213333505>
<@!247048961213333505> I congratulate you on the anniversary of the day you were exiled from your mothers vagina and had to face the cold reality that is life.
Eat lots of cake
The cake dulls the pain of existence with its sweet flavor
I got a message like that this morning but they said that I was banished from the puss
Equally as enjoyable
Damn someone stole my line
The phrasing is different enough
TURNITIN wouldn‚Äôt flag you, so you‚Äôre good
I appreciate it nonetheless

wait then whats <#468564713593241600> for
<#468564713593241600> is for help regarding material
just me venting lmao - i‚Äôm at a 89.999999% rn in her class and i‚Äôve got no idea what her curve is like and if i get an A pre-final then I don‚Äôt need to take her final
techinical questions
riiiip
riiip
hope you figure it out aneesh <:hypers:471374617337135134>
yes i hope you find what youre looking for
I have no idea because curves differ depending on the professor. From what I understand though, 6C generally offers a good curve since everyone dies.
ye ye thanks mate
here‚Äôs to praying she doesn‚Äôt fuck us over and give a generous curve
Pray that your professor is feeling generous with everything that's going on too.
She‚Äôs anything BUT generous
I'm at a 90% on one of my classes and to get an A (versus A-) is a 93%. I'm not sure if MATH 11 curves can make magic happen though
How is she has a teacher?
Not really that good, her lectures don‚Äôt make a lotta sense (and she just ripped podcasts from previous years and threw them in for the remote lectures this year so we have to listen to a blaring ‚ÄúGOOD MORNING CHILDREN‚Äù in every lecture), midterms are relatively hard-ish

took her for 6B tho, and it was kinda easy and manageable, and she did give a generous curve bc of the sudden change in situation. but i doubt she‚Äôll have a similar change of heart rn
i‚Äôve been tryna get into math 11 but looks like i‚Äôll have to do it in winter üòî
who are you taking it with?
I'm taking it with Bach but I just found out yesterday that this was his first time teaching the course. I don't know about other professors but I generally think they're all nasty. The course is just nasty.
It's a 5-unit course that requires a lot out of you so it's been very challenging with remote learning. Although I do not doubt his knowledge, it must be said that he has a thick asian accent that could be a problem to some.
<:sweat:713285695694831647>
Bach‚Äôs pretty good i think
Ive never taken a class with him but without his lectures i prob wont be able to pass my class
What class?
20C
<#443278526800723978> ?
i love bach w all my heart hes such a funny guy but imo he canot teach
i veyr much do not vibe w his teaching style
I don't attend his lectures shhh
it feels too scattered for me personally
<:sweat:713285695694831647>
i am a very linear stupid
as in im stupid and u needa draw the line explicitly
or else i will get lost
I get u about being too scattered tho
If someone in this channel is taking MATH 11 with Bach, can you please fill out your CAPES? We only need 1 more person to get the lowest lab removed uwu
move this to <#443278526800723978> maybe?
just a suggestion
Some profs tend to tangent off to **literally** everything else <:peepocry:640363747990306827>
i mena ttalk can also hold school stuff
you say Bach and i think of the baroque composer <:wsVsU7mxSU2FdfU5NtpgQA_thumb_470:688600982212706336>

covid angst is if u dont want it to get drowned out

Like this stuff showed up in the chinese community like ages ago but ive never seen an english equivalent until recently
<:wotthink:441465363671154698>
i remember when simp didn't mean someone that worshiped women or put them on a pedastal

we never had simp in hs
yeah we did
what did we have in hs
i only heard it in college

i don‚Äôt think i listen to sad music when i‚Äôm sad
s i m p l y simp
i said WE randy not you
or at least i did
i listen to sad music bc they‚Äôre nice to sing to NCOA BC KA
like my hs
never used simp
main def now is i would say still generally pathetically pining after someone but if you use it verb-wise ppl get what you mean and it still falls under sad/complaining
i only heard the term after college
you say we as in a generation

*mama mia*
here we go again!
SPAISU GAARU
Reo Speedwagon is p good when it comes to classic rock
more of a low key kinda vibe rather than a super upbeat i think
but i havent heard many of his songs so idrk
have you guys heard your latest trick by dire straits?
If you're looking for classic rock, I'm gonna suggest The Who
yess
the who
havent heard much of their stuff tho
not super classic but Radiohead
is my fucking jam
i know like one song
Also, Paranoid and Master of Reality by Black Sabbath are both great albums
their early work isn't super like "metal" or whatever, it's more like heavy rock
ohh yea i love paranoid
havent listened to master of reality tho
so if even if you aren't big into metal, I recommend those albums
is paranoid super metal?
it feels more like rock
Yeah, by today's standards it sounds more like rock
but at the time, it was kinda out there
fair enough
> Miggy stop thinking about me it‚Äôs showing in your typos
<@!245736329382461440>  WAIT I DIDNT EVEN NOTICE I TYPED YOUR NAME IN THAT HOLY SHIT
true metal is like insane tho
like damn their vocal chords
hella impressive
oh yeah, it's a feat
I feel like metal is the last genre with real "virtuoso" musicians
> i asked my grandma why she didn‚Äôt like the beatles and she said ‚Äúmen are ugly, like ABBA is prettier‚Äù JCKANDJS
<@!652073170890915864> runs in the family
CBAOJDAJ
ur dad: <:yeet:442868651792793601>
yea electronic is great and takes skill as well but something about real instruments is just like
idk how to explain it
but Pink Floyds dark side of the moon
took music production to a whole new level
and they had like no computers or anything
so making those sounds were just incredible
yall should listen to the album if you havent already
pure genius
but you gotta listen from beginning to end
none of that shuffle nonsense
its really an incredible album that is basically just 2 really long songs
oh also probably self explanatory
but I enjoyed Dark Side of The Moon the most while uhh
pharmaceuticals
not like at a rave tho
like the uhh fungus kind
not condoning drug use
be responsible kids
but by itself it is already an incredible album
but yea look up acid rock
it is an incredible subgenre of rock that really tests the creative limits of music

Lettuce clubs started at some other university as a secret club right?

i still dont get the point of lettuce club
They met once a year

And ate lettuce
its a money laundering scheme
i also remember hearing about lettuce club during freshman year

It‚Äôs because we are near the city precinct

actually i can get an A- if i get above a 82 ish <:thonk:440231969796784128>
<:sad_dab:613867302701760542>
henry im assuming we can get a 90 on hw6 or 7
<:pain:713285895419330591>
üôÇ
cuz our 77.5 is killing us lOL
some heavy hw calculations going on
actually a tutor made us a nice final grade calculator for our class
so that was really cool
and we stan
If only we put as much brain power into the final as we do into calculating what grade we need
TRUE
<@!144994874570047488> havent you been roasted for this before
calculating your grade instead of studying
<a:hahakek:676470025317777484>
<:kek:490008924414803968>
yeah he has
yea
math 183
stonk
Grade calculations is both fun and terrifying.
I can get a guaranteed A at 93% (I'm at 90% I think) but that would mean getting a 92% on the final
I love calculating my grades over and over
<a:pepeHandRub:588066901784002733>
I think I'll just take the A- and save me pain and suffering from attempting to get through a final
I know I have 1 A and one A+ in the bag thanks to the whole situation
Meanwhile my genetics class is not making finals optional but I need to ace that to get an A
But the rest are a grade calculating nightmare
A+ dont mean much tho but flexing :((
<:FeelsBadMan:441463646124507136>
I know
I wish it did
I wish it gave an extra grade boost or something
I have a guaranteed A and a highly probable A
A- guaranteed, A maybe if 90% --> 93% needed for an A from curve??
And genetics is just silly hehexd
An A in one of my classes is 80%
i WISH
But thats because the midterm averages were 70% before all this started
Let alone
Now
damn
Oh nope, looks like its still a 70% average for the midterm/final
> I love calculating my grades over and over
<@!181482518107783168>  does that not stress you out
But she did go to multiple choice
im really sad for one of my classes.  went from a 97% to a 94% cause of one midterm
Yes <@!219584106550263809>
But I also love to know all my outcomes
that resulted from stupid small mistakes despite knowing 100% of the material reeeee
I felt that
I stopped doing that because it stresses me the fuck out
I've done that in some classes <@!186011132325003264>
Knowing exactly what i need to pass
I just dont check my grade till the end
it's over
So it doesnt mess up my energy
I am stressed about MCWP I'll say that
<a:pepekms:689625546698915962>
<:PepeKMS:580487942259212288>
I have no idea what my grade will be
<:pepeKMS:716112758243983453>
I got a B/B+ in one assignment
But thats the ONLY thing we have graded
<:sweats:664643494995820554>
Not the remaining 80% or whatever of our grade
I could get a C+
Or an A+
Who knows
Can't even calculate it
<:PepeKMS:580487942259212288>
<@!314229461396488195> Wat happn

O
<:PepeKMS:580487942259212288>
For which class
i was so closed to fixing it then, 11:59 happened
whats bash
:(
Unix shell
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
<:PepeKMS:580487942259212288>
time to go play urf until i am forced to take my 12 final
15l
sam
it was 15l
Bash is really good for simple stuff but is ultimately C
And Python can do more than Bash
they made us count the characters of each line and sort them into an array
then output it
<:PepeKMS:580487942259212288>
<:ew:619334178357641237>
i dont know bash syntax so that's what i got stuck on
90% of the time
On their Linux systems or the ancient version OSX uses?
ssh in their system
Ah so Linux / Windows
GPLv3 probs
<:PepeKMS:580487942259212288>
i hate bash language so much
<:pepeKMS:716112758243983453>
time to go make some chicken
breast
in the oven
Just remember at the end of the day
C
*I agree with Gary on at least that*

Does anyone listen to music to go to sleep? ü§î
Not like whale sounds or heavy rain sounds or whatever  but like if you can‚Äôt sleep so you listen to music ü§î
i play it
quietly
w out lyrics
sometimes
Ooo ok
When I was younger i did that
I tried that
I even downloaded that one app that lets you modify sounds or like stories
to fall asleep
did not work
but thats just because insomnia
i doo!!
that what my insomnia playlist for lmaoo
but also ambient sounds are really nice to listen to as well
^ ive tried music with earphones on and on speakers
earphones for me seem to work better
i don‚Äôt ever want to talk to andrew again
o
u guys listen to music to sleep
he stands for everything i‚Äôm against
i watch bon appetit .....
o
You think that's weird? My sister watches forensic files
i used to watch criminal minds to sleepüëÅüëÑüëÅ so similar ig
and then i stopped bc i got sm nightmares LMAO
Lol
I took melatonin but I'm still not sleepy <:PEPESCREAM:466446495747670027>
I feel that would be me if I took melatonin
Rn
Aight imma try sleep
Gn everyone
nightt!
Night luke <a:weeHypers:695830734509834281>
I knew someone who watched surgery videos while eating.
my sister went to sleep on the couch so for the last 3(?) hours, her perfume has been making me mildly nauseous <:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
Kill.
lol
im also just particularly nose sensitive to like, aerosols and certain scents
On second thought, death doesn‚Äôt remove perfume but will replace it with citrusy decomposition.
Mmmm..
well im going to be now, so its over
but ye, perfumes and stuff are common at parties, so thats another reason i dont like parties
I don‚Äôt get perfume at the parties I attend.
was that necessary to say? idk, its the truth, i might be crackhead hours talking
I should stop telling myself i dont like parties/am not social tho
Cuz that just leads to confirmation bias and self fulfilling prophecy
Y‚Äôall ever been too sad to sleep but you don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre sad? <:cryangry:606031757099401217>
F
Depression is stinky.
^
I do be sad but 95% of the ttime I know why im sad
but I don't know how to make myself unsad
partner make sad unsad
whats a partner ? <:thonK:500668461501120525>
never heard of those

I think partner means like a dog or cat or some type of pet ü§î

hmmm doesn't seem so <:thonK:500668461501120525>

Why do modern Ferrari's idle so damn loud
I can hear it in my room
<:cursecat:612044490307272727>
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
This guy needs to move his car out of muh street
Or I'll send the SubarBRO out
Actually I don't want to do that his WRX is horrifyingly loud
ain't nothing wrong with a loud exhaust
but like
people can get exhaust cutouts
to close off the valves when they drive through residentials
so they don't end up annoying people
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
Most cars have that now for emissions
that, and some new cars like the mustang GT have active exhaust
which basically is that
I hate BMW for nerfing my car
The exhaust is shut in drive no matter what because of CA emissions
active exhaust/active exhaust doesnt nerf your car
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
because you can just open the valves
lol
Not anymore I can't
why?
Its the same with the optional Camaro exhaust
CA emissions
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
Its open in Park or Reverse
Which is big dumb
i have an SS dude
2021 MY
but lucky mine is a 2013
so none of that BULLSHIT
But in the case of BMW they nerfed older cars
Via OTA
i mean you can probably just tune that out tho
it isnt the end of the world
remove the shit and tune whatever makes it do that out of the computer
It isn't on the same system as the ECU so its pretty easy
ECU tuning is a big no thanks
exactly
so just do that
Too hard
I do but its smart
And resets
just go to a tuner
Same deal bruh
that might know a better way
can you remove the part itself?
that closes off your valves
Yeah you can just open the electronic actuator, but then it gets hella loud
I actually like it quiet in Comfort
Or Eco
welp
At least I didn't get a 2020MY
idk then chief
id never it in comfort, so id probably just remove it
Where they coded out all the throatiness
with those settings, id constantly have it in track
lmfao
I need comfort to get my 42 highway
Lmao
maan
what bmw do you have?
2019 330i pre/engine tweaks
aint nobody got time for gas mileage
buy a civic for that
üòÇ
I'm paying for it now so you bet I got time for it lmao
lmao
If I was back in Texas sure
yeah, i understand
Where its what
1.50$?
A gallon
WTF
For 93
ive never seen those gas prices
in my entire life
Prices collapsed nationwide bruh
ive always been in cali
yeah ik
It was like 1$ for a bit in some places
but never to that
amount
here
LOL
yurr
cheapest i saw was $2.86 in davisd
Cheapest I saw here was 2.89$ for 91 in Convoy
and i thought that was mega cheap for here
$2.86 for 91
But that lasted for maybe
3-4 days
LOL
it be like that chief
well, on the inverse of this
Only good news is thanks to COVID my cars costing me basically nothing
imma get a corsa Xtreme catback soon
so my shit's gonna sound hella good
Insurance is about 120$ a month before COVID rebates right now
Its comfy
gotta get that with AFM tune
Given I'm fully insured as an only driver at 21
<a:pepeHandRub:588066901784002733>
mhmm
yeah, insurance is not bad on those lol
When I saw my car was cheaper to insure than a new Camry
I loled
once u get to 400+ bhp stock is when it gets expensive
for young drivers
Nobody seems to be crashing this new gen
Compared to the F30 anyway
well thats good
my friend, do you use your turn signals?
Naturally
good man
And lord if I didn't the car wouldn't have it
dont be a typical bmw driver
u did good, son
The lane departure assist is fairly aggressive
Because its an active system that will avoid other cars in accidents
thats probably why less of them are being crashed
Highly likely
the computer helps you drive in that thing
I'm all for two things
autonomous braking, and blind spot monitors
That and maybe a rear view camera
The rest can shove it
blind spot monitors, for sure
the breaking, yeah it's cool
I ain't gonna use no 3D surround camera
but i feel like it takes away from the drivers' experience
if you want a true drivers' car
Auto braking is just for crashes lmao
nothing wrong with it for a normal car
yeah, for situations like that for sure
Plus in BMWs its nice
if it just breaks when youre about to hit something
I push one button
that would be nice
Everything off
Thats how all the systems work
but if it always hits the breaks for u when u let off the gas
like teslas do
Its basically mandated by the feds now
i dont like that
Oh thats for regen
i saw bmw
who wants to be murdered by a diesel bmw
My car will do that but only if you are going downhill
So you stay at a steady speed
To charge my battery
teslas do that because of their theory for making the most efficient use of energy. when u let off the gas, it breaks, then takes all of that energy and puts it back into the battery
Yes
it's a cool theory
oh no a car person
You can just turn it off
porsche does it the opposite way though
Which is what I did when I drove a Model 3
<a:monkaShoot:699841146943176734>
they prefer letting it course through
<#479753772323700746>
you hoes
they think thats more efficient
WHOMSZT
Porsche let you choose between coasting regen and braking regen or both in the Taycan
Heavy braking regen is the best
oh really? i thought it just lets you coast
Which is what Audi also use
i saw matt farah's review on it and thats what he said
No you get 20-21% extra braking force
On top of the what 10 piston calipers
Lmao
interesting
Shared with the Urus
and holy shit, yeah those are big
And other VW products
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
makes sense tho with the torque on those things

wait ur
sometimes ppl assume im chinese bc of my last name

my chinese teacher did AHAHAH
i don't think anyone ever assumed i was viet
until <@!151123898698563584>  ngl
like my tagline states
i am mostly jungly jungle asian
i didn't rlly consider myself part chinese for my whole life
jeff
i just said
it's still hard to call myself part chinese now
i assumed u were a balloon
yea and i assumed you were a dumb bi-
ay you dummies stop fighting
chickens, pls

what longboi said
i said nothin
hey i'm just stating the facts here
but the facts
yo thats my line
we do not claim our colonizers
the french?
the chinese too
the zulus
unless my history be wrong
thems too
tfw ur dad's side is chinese and u felt weird being associated with them bc u didn't know the language 4 19 yrs
someone said ho chi minh
i was tryna go there this year
here we go
but then rona struck
and ?
i thought u were gna make a vn war joke
no lol
which i am sick of LMAO
tyty
thank god
np
yeah, i was actually learning viet for a while this year and last year
anyway why vn in particular?
on duolingo
anh biet noi nhieu chua?
im not viet myself but im interested in the place and culture
so i wanted to visit
i know it's beautiful there
how much can i converse with ya then 0:
hmm
that's p cool! also like what got u interested in vn in the first place
i understood i few of those words
on a scale from one to ten i am in the second grade
biet means speak
noi is like language
know*
anh is like he
yeah, know
yeeee
my bad
im a little rusty
no worries
havent done my lessons in a couple months
been doing japanese lately
hmmm do diacritics help?
the think with duo is that
oh wow 0:
the viet course is pretty bad for learning how to speak
for reading and writing it's pretty good
i learned a lot while i was doing it daily
but the words are so hard to pronounce for a non-native speaker
gotchu, idr if duo had pronunciations?
and they dont do a very good at teaching you that
they do pronounce the words
it's just very bad
it's like an extremely bad northern accent
ur right on with tht, it's p hard
tbf the five different tones dont help very much either
^^^^
it's because of the intonations
yeah
i grew up speaking viet and im still terrible
to my knowledge only viet and chinsese has those
english is such a monotonous lang
and it's very hard
so switching from tht to viet is def a challenge
bro if u pronounce the word for rice
with a slightly different tone
u end up saying cum
imagine going to a restaurant in ho chi minh and ordering a bowl of cum
lmfao
thats what scares me about it
i have to be spot on
the joke would fly over viet ppl's heads trust me
or people wont know wtf im saying
they'd just think u were pronouncing it wrong
which
case in point
true
but still
for more complicated sentences, i feel that having an accent will make it hard to communicate with the actual people who natively know the language
so it takes a lot of practice
since you asked, part of my motivation for going there this summer was to learn the language better
would u say u have a northern accent then
since i was super on that
uhh
i might
since i learned from duo
and it uses a northern accent
albeit, a very bad one
tht's the most common when nonnative speakers learn but idk why tbh
idk either
i dunno much abt linguistics to say AHAHA
haha
it's all good
we love language immersion
i find it funny that japanese is like an exact inverse of viet, in that the speaking to me is really freaking easy, but the writing is balls deep hard
but im super intrigued bc highkey i always hear abt non azn ppl wanting to learn korean or japanese
but never viet
while in viet, the writing to me isnt really hard at all with some practice, but the speaking is so hard
so i was v pleasantly surprised
yeah
i wanted to learn viet before japanese
but i stopped cuz the duo doesnt teach speaking very well
yeah understandable! the grammar is on par with chinese, simple enough but the tones will trip ya up
i think in general, it's best to learn the language in the actual country
or with people who speak
if i was viet, it would be way easier since id have family who speak it
but it's ok
i'll get back to it eventually
lmk if u ever need a speaking partner! hmu in one of the voice channels n we can chat
sure!
im down
> if i was viet, it would be way easier since id have family who speak it
waiiiit dope
would have to practice some duolingo lessons for a bit
to get warmed up
haha ofc, no rush; honestly this summer is gna be p chill
summer seshes aside xd
i agree dude
im not doing any summer sesh since im a new transfer here
but my whole 2019 was hell
did fam motivate u to learn viet?
so this is all rest and relaxation
bc for me i learned mandarin to communicate with my dad's fam better
nah, like i said, im not vietnamese. im persian
i just felt like learning it
my fam are only persian
wait i read wrong
no worries
yeah, my second language is farsi
> if i was viet, it would be way easier since id have family who speak it
<@!85061459670740992> misread thinking u had fam who spoke viet sfkjhfjs
i cant read or write, but im fluent speaking
It's all good
tht's p dope
ye
i love farsi cuz so many people dont know it so
with another farsi speaker, it's like having a secret language
i think knowing a second lang is one of the best skills to have
outside
i absolutely agree
love tht notion, codespeak, if u will
yessir!
and i think polyglots r so fucking cool LMAO wish i had more time to learn languages
but ya
spanish is so useful, tht's a lang i wish i picked up
pretty much all of my mom's siblings know 5 or more languages
so i want to know a few too
i want to learn japanese, german and viet
and maybe like french after that
and spanish... cuz it's spanish
german is a cool sounding language
i took 3 years of it in hs but i dont know shit lmao
wait ario hollup lemme show up sth
sure
check <#650931041334460433> it's one of my fave tiktoks bc 4 languages included
kk
the german guy LMFAO
SENDSSS
i love german hahaha üòÇ
there's a pt 2 tht's also funny asf
i love how sharp it sounds
it is definitely a very rough language
a language pet peeve i have: when ppl say langs sound ugly
and i personally think it's the toughest of the european languages to learn how to write in
like bruh????????????
there are so many freaking rules
yeah
i feel that
ooof grammar rules as bad as english?
my mom didnt like the sound of viet when i was learning it
but i was like
bruh stop
just let me learn
WHERE IS YEN
i take such offense when ppl say viet sounds bad like um
<@!245736329382461440>
<@!245736329382461440> hiii
also i think the grammar rules are worse in german than english
and yeah, i understand
that would annoy me too
oh damn big rip
if people said it about farsi
which is why i dont say those things
i also dont think it sounds ugly
it's just freaking hard to pronounce some of the words
because a different tone means totally different word half the time
and like, the alphabet isnt that big, so there are a lot of similarities in sounds
AND TOLD THE G TO SOMETIMES SOUND LIKE A Z
LIKE BRO
to me, yeah i get it viet can be harsh but tht's just bc we're blaring them at 90 dB outta our mouths
fax no printer
BAHAHAHAHAHHAHA i feel ari
yeah
there's no quiet way to speak viet
lmao
yesss dino
it's just so fast too bruh
like i really like the model
the best way is to TALK LLLAAAAAHKE THIIIS
named Ng·ªçc Trinh
model of farsi or viet?
But like
OH actual model
SOMETIMESYOUJUSTGOTTASTARTTALKINGLIKETHISINVIET

i wonder what happend to xuan mai
idk her
she went down p badly >:
i just know trinh and a couple others
:(((
xuan mai was like the golden child on 2000s viet
had concerts and all that to teach kids viet when she was a kid too
prob made hella bank
thats hella dope
oh she's nguoi nam!
she went to bolsa?????
lakjsdhfiwufehlkasjdhf

LMAOOOO ALL MY INTL FRIEND FOLLOW HER
yuh
T√¥i mu·ªën b√°nh m√¨

the extent of my powers

üòÇ
FROM MUELLER
AH YES HE CALLED ME
it was a wholesome call
toi cung muon banh mi luon
iconic
what is cung and luon
i love how he thinks of us when he's drunk
aw mueller
cung = also, luon is like as well
i miss him <:pepehands:464568955533524992>
like they go in a pair
ah i see
makes sense
wait do diacritics help u
what are diacritics
he said some really nice things i was like <:peepocry:640363747990306827>
sybols
dee symbols ehe
oh, all the accents?
yuhh
i mean, they kinda complicate things a little but
it's not hard to memorize which word gets what
i think the would help A LOT more if duolingo actually taught you
which diacritic symbol goes with
what sound
because they dont ever teach you that
they just throw words at you
and it's up to you to figure it out
ario th√≠ch ƒÉn moÃÅn vi√™Ã£t g√¨?
by memorizing what words have what sounds
hmm i wonder wht ur name would be in viet
T√¥i th√≠ch ph·ªü v√† c∆°m
And beef bowls
Beef or chicken bowls at Viet places are good
Also the tea

youre starting to sound like a boomer

my 1-2 years over u already makes me a boomer
:^)
maybe
whomst
w h o m s t
what classes are you taking next quarter <@!85061459670740992>
h  o e m s t
idk yet
gotta talk to my counselor once the registration for classes starts
or a little before that i guess
rn im just tryna get my financial aid, housing, and transcript stuff secured
the neuros unite
neubros
FACTS
NEURBROS
i imagine i'll have to take o-chem
but honestly
if i can avoid taking it my first semester here
I WOULD LIKE THAT
o-chem is not a class u want to be taking when youre getting acclimated to a place
but probably gotta take it
so idk
im not a chem major because of ochem
^
fuck o-chem
ochems easy
why do i gotta do this shit for neuro
and med school
oChEmS eASy
leave me alone!!!
says chem major
tutor me then <@!210429883665481730>
what makes you think I'm a chem major
<:xd:612726759846051861>
xd
i'll give u that BREAD
:]
i bought organic as a second language
just to read ahead of time
who to you recommend at sd for o-chem <@!210429883665481730>
preferably not a hard-ass teacher that makes the class harder than it already is
> ochems easy
<@!210429883665481730> tell that to hoeger
I can tell you not to take oconnor
got it
Hoeger is good
wait I saw neuro heLlLo
hola
hoeger good
just a lil crazy though
is he chill or?
he likes anime
oconnor rambles and goes on very long tangents
i prefer a chill teacher whos laid back
OH YESSIR
WE'D GET ALONG
he's chill but also demands a lot from his students
can be very intimidating no bs type prof
imma peep his ratemyprofessor

if you're on confessions of the meme page he pops up a decent amount
lmfao
the search
dude has a solid 4/5
not bad i guess

thats fair for an o-chem class
but it depends on what "heavily" means to this person
most ochem classes have a thiccccccccccc curve
if you got 100/150 on the midterms you're set for at least a B+
imagine getting a B
you wanna know what happened with the class i dropped in the spring?
in a class
<:pepehands:464568955533524992>
our teacher literally passed away
week 3
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
had like no one for a week
then a really hard-ass teacher took over
promised heavy curves because of all the chaos
and how behind we got from his own class
and then
we curved our exam
8 points
out of 128 total points
that is not a heavy curve
so, to me, it depends on what heavy means to these people
have you taken an ochem course before??
or nah
yes
Neurbros for life. I need to get that book to read.
i took first semester twice
and keep in mind it's semester not quarter
it's kinda like a chem curve but on drugs
hi nathan :oooooooo
<a:catHello:704415151683534878>
had to drop it the first time for reasons that were outside my control
like a midterm average would be less than 50%
second try i didnt try much in the spring
The book is $40??
didnt like where my grade was at
and covid happened
and my teacher died
literally
so i dropped again
oof
ochem on a quarter system sucks major ass
but you get it done and over with
so ive been exposed to a lot of the material
honestly, i like the quarter system tho
it doesnt drag on
you just put all your effort in for a short burst of time
and get it done
and the amount of material that u cover in a quarter is less
yeeeee
i probably
literally
know all of the first quarter's material
and just have to refresh
and really refine it
this time around
which is why i bought the second language book to read over the summer
you'll probably do decently
im not playing around this time
hopefully
i really do not like labs
i think the hardest thing for me was just memorizing all of the mechanisms
and resonance forms
but lab and lecture are separate classes at UC's, right?
Which book did you get specifically?
and yes, definitely
for my old class or the second language book?
yeah lab and lecture are separate
Second language.
that is fantastic
i'll show you
I'm taking ochem this upcoming quarter :))))

aye man, who u taking it with?
we can take the same one
gl boys
im tryna choose whoever is the chillest and best one
available
don't cry *too* much
When is your enrollment?
and preferable NOT an early morning class
idk yet bro
i dont know how it works for transfers
I have it with Albizati. I'll send the course section.
I have no idea how transfers work too.
i heard hes good but
let's all take 43a together !
I'll see you next year or during summer for that.
unless ur doing it all fall then nvm
i read his rate my professor and some things concerned me
im doing it in fall zoey
I'm taking 40A
not fully registered yet to take a summer class
43A fall? wHY
cuz im a transfer
thats the soonest i can take classes
plus, i dont want to take a summer class rn
i want to rest
albizatiiiiiii
my guyyy
I chose Albizati over Hoeger because I heard the latter's ability to teach during the online format has been completely horrific.
prof for it fall has bad reviews, also not fan of remote lab
i have albizati rn and the guy is a g
so that's why i decided against it
For class?

He's a really chill professor. I wish I could see him shoot hoops like before.

wait he was actually
trash
these reviews kinda concerned me
in chem 6a
but i heard he's good at 40a
soo
gen chem i heard he's not good
but ochem he is
yeah, people say hes a bad gen chem teacher
yea i didnt like him in chem 6a
all selfteach
thats the case for a lot of o-chem profs tbh
i have him for 40b
he's also an industry guy
so he works a lot more with the ochem stuff in general
It's too late now I suppose. I had a positive experience with him for 6A.
wait when did u take 6a with him
Winter first year
you should be good nathan
wait
bruh same
bruh
bruh
is ternansky any good?
his tests are
decent
Remember when that scooter started blaring in the middle of class?
not fun
LOL
is what ive heard
Ternansky is good for premed students I've heard.
i think hes the one you told me to avoid <@!251234796670418946>
he rly spent time to shoot hoops
i think he went crazy during a lecture once though
ternansky radiates old man energy
is he the 35% midterm average one?
yes
fuck that then
never mind
hoooop
i had him for 40b and NOPED
Shooting hoops with his lecture notes <:PatrickGasm:600914637940326400>
NOPE
^^
thats most ochem classes thoughhh
miss me with that
> Remember when that scooter started blaring in the middle of class?
<@!186011132325003264> 6b?
6A Albizati
your class it is <@!186011132325003264>
pardon, 6a
40A albizati
i had 6b with young
NOO
SAME
I DID NOT LIKE
YOUNG
albizati is a homie
can confirm
brydges ftw
had him for 6a
a true lad
albizati is hella cool
Young was a horrible teacher. Too be fair he's fairly new back then.
also bussey
But I had to self-teach mostly.
wtfff ok i just didnt like him for 6a
fml
I had Hoeger for 6C and I survived so do I get a t-shirt?
yall should see his kids in the background of his zoom lectures
hella funny
his midterm and final was so str8forward
yesssss he always changed the bkgrds
sho cute
no guys, debelouchina for 6c
best prof
sweetest prof
That final at the gym was lowkey horrifying. I had SAT flashbacks <@!151123898698563584>
YES
SAME
i had hoeger for chem 4 and he was all bark lil bite
AP TESTING PTSD TOO
<:shookhamster:606593747010060326>
omfg
i saw ap testing
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
Debelouchina is an actual name?
imagine needing to take ochem
https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1846849 https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=2131837 https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=2417219 what about these profs?
they have really good feedback
bertrand also a lowkey homie
she's the most caring gen chem prof I've ever had i loved her
I have never heard of them. I heard Bertrand was.. interesting but nice?
i havent heard anything about the others
are these guys teaching in the fall?
and dang
why these guys so unknown?
A SCAM
> i saw ap testing
<@!314229461396488195>
tb to when i took 7 ap tests senior yr and only like 2 of them helped for ucsd credits
it is a scam
O'Conner, Hoeger, and Albizati are teaching this upcoming fall.
somehow iw as able . to take ap tests for $5 a test
<a:ohohoho:636686946734964786>
also only helps for enrollment times
they're probably only part-time lecturers
i see
the ones everyone knows lecture all year
so out of those, you guys recommend albizati?
yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
okay, his class it is then
hopefully i get it
i will waitlist that shit if i have to
I wish I could've taken the neurobiology lab this quarter but it literally conflicted with my entire schedule of classes.
that sucks
everything is like
TuThu
at the WORST times
what is the minimum amount of classes we have to take?
That's what happens when you throw a 5-hour lab course into the middle of a schedule.
5 hours lab <:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
For financial aid, I think it's 12?
12 units?
ye
12 units or 3 courses
<:Ping:567963841204453386>
that is perfect
3 courses is very healthy
i'll take o-chem with two easy classes
<a:PEPESCREAM:659115134089822288>
i really do not want anything tasking with o-chem
Why did I scroll up
I'm taking PHYS 1A/1AL, CHEM 40A, BIPN 148, and PHIL 28 next quarter <:jesuspepe:567197534548656147>
because
you're an ib
person
don't do mcwp
at the same time
<a:PEPESCREAM:659115134089822288>
I saw the chav
i have to do physics too for my lower division but
soul-sucking.
Impression
<:cursecat:612044490307272727>
idk if i want to do physics
and o chem
hup hup hup
at the same time
<:gun2:607557159768686592>
that sounds like hell bro
pip pip cheerio
which physics?
<a:monkaShoot:699841146943176734>
> Impression
<@!181482518107783168> DISCLAIMER I SAID IT WAS BAD DIDN'T I
is PHIL 28 logic?
1 series ?
wait sorry I'm taking
phil 28 is a writing class
intro to logic
1C/1CL
<a:topKek:538017398419226634>
1 series because why would I ever take the 2 series
if it's like phil 27
anyways
nah, it's ethics
nvm
prof tsai is actually the sweetest guy
i could take that
<a:PEPESCREAM:659115134089822288>
PINGED
ethics n society = phil 28
as an easy class
yeah it's ethics, but basically an extra writing clas
s
I'm taking the majority of the physics courses over summer so I want to finish the series fall <@!85061459670740992>
<a:hahakek:676470025317777484>
I only do logic PHIL classes
it's writing class in disguise
nice
for us warren
Which is why I took PHIL 10
students
i'll talk to my counselor and see what i can do
And now 12
if i want to stay on track
but not be overwhelmed
with the curriculum
If you want to try for an UD neuro course maybe you can take BIPN 148 with me
how many ge classes do u have to do, ario
The key to staying on track
Is closing your eyes
u taking that in the fall?
i could
And pretending
Yeah
thats an option
isn't 148 like
learning
i would actually love to take an actual neuro class for once
BIPN 148 - Cellular Basis of Learning & Memory
and memory ?
all ive done is major prep
I'm assuming lots of LTP stuff
and intro to psych
lmao
NMDA receptors and glutamate and all that
LOL remembered that
let me study the brain for once
fuck
<a:PepePopcorn:554328145344462848>
LTP
It will be
L o n g  t e r m  d e p r e s s i o n
i'll take note of that tho
But thats easy mode tier neuro
so i could take o-chem, that neuro class
Even if we still don't understand much
and ethics
who wants to take bibc with me....
and that would be 3 courses
~~understand anything~~
It's an upper-division class strictly on learning and memory though so it might get into nitty-gritty details.
do i need any prereqs to take it?
Unfortunately, there are not a lot of good BIPN courses offered during fall that isn't basic human physiology <@!85061459670740992>
Ohhhh.. let me check.
You need BIPN 100
Like olfaction, or gustation, the nitty gritty of memory is pretty all over the place
Which is offered hint hint wink wink
is that gen bio?
human physio
Human Physiology I
oh i dont have that
so i need that
is it really hard?
nah
Human Physiology <:ew:619334178357641237>
cuz like, i want something thats low demanding
Action potentials, renal system, heart stuff, neuromuscular junction, all that fun jazz
with o-chem
I just look at brains
ok
<:ew:619334178357641237>
I want to look at more brains.
it's just memorization
Sounds like IB bio
so if u can do that
That's why I needed my fix of neuro
i can do that
I just take random behavioural neuro and neuro psych classes
<a:pepeHandRub:588066901784002733>
just depends on how much
cuz im already gonna be memorizing mechanisms
I don't know any low demanding course but I feel like I'm the person who has taken the most UD neuro classes on this discord so far <:shook:606018427018149889>
So I'll let you know what I find LMAO
I just wish these courses started further along
<a:PEPESCREAM:659115134089822288>
thank you
Like gib me something advanced
keep in touch with me on that
I'll definitely talk about my courses on here to try to get a certain someone to switch majors
*cough* <@!652073170890915864>
lmao
i haven't done a lot, so nathan's good for asking about that LOL. beenn grinding through all the ge's and phys/chem classes
Human Bio
<:ew:619334178357641237>
facts tho
i need to do my physics and o-chem
to finish my lower dvision
lowkey wish i did it at CC
but oh well
I can't stand the general bio or chem requirements
that would be another year or two
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
b4 transfering
Or I'd be right in Neuro
I was a clinical psychology major before switching so I'm still doing my lower division requirements. By the end of the year I would be done though.
im not trying to be decrepit before i go to uni
The lower div Bio courses are so so basic
true
bild 2 is dumb
I did BILD 3 and fell asleep never wanting to touch anything ever again
i didnt rly care for gen bio
tho i took honors
It wasn't even IB
so we got to do our own research
It was GCSE tier at best
As long as you take BIPN 100 that counts for a lot of prereqs already
that was cool
ok then i should def take that
if it's not too hard
> GCSE
Yes
Nathan
üßê
bicd 100?
<a:PepePopcorn:554328145344462848>
Genetics?
genetics is cool
yall take that?
i love that stuff
I'm getting board of Psych classes
I'm taking it right now and dying. Please don't take it with Professor Day
noted
I swear he's going OFF curriculum
i have it with reuther rn and i need a...... 62.5% on the final to get an A in it
i wish i could talk genetics
shit is cool
WHAT
I WISH
nice
so i'd say im doing well
LOL
> i have it with reuther rn and i need a...... 62.5% on the final to get an A in it
<@!251234796670418946> Sounds like Reuther
i love being in that position
What topics are you covering for th efinal
come finals time
mendelian inheritance onwards
please dont say deviations from men- NOOO
oh thats not too bad
oh
how onwards
that was in gen bio
like.. hardy-weinberg/evolutionary genetics
<:ew:619334178357641237>
Oh god
not tooo baaadddd
We didn't even touch upon that.
IB Bio flashbacks
<:sweats:664643494995820554>
we went over that in my gen bio class
We went through mendelian inheritance the first week of class tbh
but not into as much depth as probably a dedicated genetics class would take it
reuther starts off with the central dogma
Mendelian inheritance is definitely basic basic tier
and then goes into mendelian genetics
it is
says it's important to understand the mechanics before understanding inheritance and whatnot
The problem with Professor Day is that he goes through topics with an examples-based learning technique. There is very little traditional teaching and more explaining through examples alone.
<a:PepePopcorn:554328145344462848>
He also didn't go through a lot of the mechanics.
Mendelian deviations
Pedigrees
Linkage
thats annoying
I'm guessing are topics
so who do you recommend?
pedigrees are fun they're like
lil puzzles
<#639954541617348618>
Reuther I suppose.
<a:PepePopcorn:554328145344462848>
Mhm
Thing is
UCSD please gib me something new
<:peepocry:640363747990306827>
What urks me is that I took Day JUST BECAUSE it fit my schedule better time-wise
And now we have asynchronous
I could've gotten an A <:pepehands:464568955533524992>
what time is it?
I swear I might just start taking aerospace courses or something
It's 12:28AM.
i like to avoid early morning classes
if i can
I get bored too easily
thats not too bad
No, it's 12:28AM *right now*
i find it harder to do well in super early classes
Right now early classes are ok *if* they are asynch
i like studying before exams on the same time in additioon to previous studying cuz
Because I can handle an 8am midterm
fresh in brain
and i dont like waking up early
if i take an early class, it better be writing
But I tend to just watch some lectures and go into finals praying to various gods and demons
late(ish) classes also correlate to later final exam times
later final exam dates or just the time in the day?
Works fairly well
Time of day
time of day
cuz if it's just later in the day, then it's perfect
so it's nice
yeah
thats dope
I hope that with the next quarter comes time for me to refresh and start anew on a winning streak like before. I was killing it winter quarter with my work ethic and felt really happy about my life. Then everything changed <:pepehands:464568955533524992>
facts
fresh start boys
i want to stay on top of everything
maybe have a study group or something
only class i prob can't get an A in though is MCWP 50... haha...
if we have the same classes
I hope I can manage all As this quarter. Genetics will be the toughest one (and MATH 11 if I decide to take the final lmao..)
*sad muir noises*
o-chem will def be the toughest for me
Did somebody say
MCWP 50
i would be so happen
to get an A in that
<:pepeKMS:716112758243983453>
so fucjing happy
me
My essay is hot garbage
same
<:fingerguns:654792913917837313>
I can't look at it
it's just
my essays are good
There's always the future quarters. I'd be down to take required neurobiology courses with everyone here.
math and science classes be hard
BIPN 140 is my enemy
And I need to conquer it soon
I write good papers but I wrote this in...a lot shorter of a time than I should have
<:fingerguns:654792913917837313>
draft 3 the day it was due
even then, MCWP is very specific about .... how they want you to write
math make brain hurty
Oh god yes
i never even draft
I hate MCWPs restrictions
i just write them and get A's
We don't have a choice
i cant write with restrictions and prompts
writing is my speciality
my brain doesnt work like that
did you explicitly mention any "warrants"
Normally I just pump out a cute Cogs essay in 30 minutes
yeah i just go for it
i dont need to draft
And get full marks
My warrants uhhh
my draft is just writing the whole thing then proofreading it
bc i didn't andddddddd im worried about my "elements of argument" being docked on the rubric lmao
and fixing things
I kind of went for something
*subtle*
But knowing the rubric i'll get destroyed
i just... did not
At least we don't have to take DOC
<:kek:490008924414803968>
So maybe i'll do that portfolio reflection for some 5% bonus points
dont i have to take DOC?
wait tf? ur TA is doing that?
for marshall
All TAs are
whats the ERC one
Its across the whole program
...... where?
Or at least it should be
Isn't MMW marshall
i didn't see that anywhere
It got announced in my class
After a canvas message from whatever her name is
just "you don't have to do it but you can if you want. it's a good way to wrap up the class"
The actual professor
Yes you get EC
5%
Up to
They'll still grade it and give you the marks for it
I was thinking of pumping out a garbage on tomorrow to at least score 1-2%
???? the only mention of 5% is that it's already given to you instead of having to do it
<:thonk:440231969796784128>
Our grading according to the overall professor is out of a lower total score
What class are y'all talking about? <:coconaSweat:540350619207073832>
And they are just removing it

MCWP 50
my prof said that the 5% is alreaady factored in
hmm
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
Thats different
Wow your TA is formal
My TA is just like
*yo guys*
God I love Jonathan
nah he's chill but he writes emails like that
shoutout to thomas for never roasting me
My TA just writes whatever
I'm emailing my TA in a sec so he can grade my paper before the P/NP deadline
As they are grading them on Tuesday
(at a meeting)
he offered me an extra point to my final grade for doing extra peer reviews for his other section
He said we could so I'm doing it
i was like "uh ok"
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
We don't get that
thanks THOMAS
Because we can't review the other section
We had a form where we had to pick our name
From a list
From Muir Writing
im worried im gonna get screwed over on this final draft and there goes my A..
mcwp 50 just be like that..
Annned
He responded already
Perfect
Honestly
I had a B+ in the Proposal
And don't have a grade for my AB
So I figure an A isn't happening anyway
ur AB isn't graded yet?
Nope
Lmao
hUH
i got an A- on the proposal and A on the AB so i just need to not bomb this paper rn
I got full marks on each section but I didn't do any MLA formatting or whatever LOL
My hatred for MLA was too strong
And I was lazy
LOL MLA is ez points
I haaaate it
I ended up using APA
omg..
A true format
Though the BPS version is even better
<:fingerguns:654792913917837313>
Only way he can probably tell I wrote most of it in two hours
Is that formatting
I was nice and used the correct citation formatting in the AB of course
As that took about 30 seconds
To redo
i hope u get an A on ur AB
i thought i was gonna do bad on mine bc it was .... so long
I should point out I don't even have a Writers Reference
<a:ohohoho:636686946734964786>
Garrett has it
And its an older one anyway
Mine was...
Let me check
4600 words
I CANT FIND RHE PING WTFHSDHAKDBAJXBA
also what is a reverse harem
ooh actually close, mine was 4769 words
Noice
I did the bare minimum 8 citations
yeah same
But I think my paper has...
A lot
20
i think i only have like 3 more or
...
<:fingerguns:654792913917837313>
w ow
Not a record for mew
how do you even use that many tho
like it's a short-ish paper

<a:ohohoho:636686946734964786>
That's a lot of orange.
My citations are
Varied
I ended up hitting like 4400 words and had to hit the brakes
I cut a whole section so I'm at 3600 now
i hit 4050 and had to cut bc word count
painful
I could write the section again but theres no way I can keep it under 4000 and do any justice
im attttt 3788 oops
cutting it close
So I elected to just not bother
> also what is a reverse harem
<@652073170890915864> like a
Whats your paper on
<@!251234796670418946>
Muir gang <@!186011132325003264>
"Improving upon Reforestation Techniques using Fractal Geometry on Trees and Forests" this is my dumb title
O

Uh
*well*
<:fingerguns:654792913917837313>
so that gives a smol idea
Yours sounds fancy
*varied source*
I like
Mine you think is simple then you reach the section that says
*building a global brain*
And shit hits the fan
when a lady be the center of attn in a grp of guys 0: <@652073170890915864>
wait who's asking u this
THE BOI
bc he was asking what mangas i read when i was younger
and i mentioned fruits basket
and he was like
‚Äúomy a reverse harem‚Äù and i was like... wtf is a reverse harem...
LMAOOOFOSKFODSF
Basically my paper builds a giant cognitive system made up of items called Cognizers, which are functional systems made up of humans and digital technology
what's your topic hUh
Uhhhhh
im glad ur keeping up a volley with him tho
Massive Scaled Emergent Cognitive Systems
<:nyello:441469558423814144>
what
<:thinkies:713308987843674153>
ima pretend i didnt see that
The behavioural neruo background is 'the global brain'
Which is a very new term
my research paper doesn't really match my course theme but the TA approved it so i mean
My course theme was cyborgs
it sounded like on of those titles where it's just jargon mashed together to sound technical
<:fingerguns:654792913917837313>
The jargon only gets crazier
Especially when the neuroscience gets involved
my TA keeps commenting how he doesn't know wtf is going on in my paper and how i need to keep in mind that the audience is a fellow MCWP 50 student
^
Same
so I've had to tone down and explain every little *fractal* detail
and im like... just google what a fractal is pls..
I can only survive on the fact that my TA is a comm grad focusing on social systems
That did neuro and psych at undergrad
so much orange
good
<:xd:612726759846051861>
no
if only muir chat channel was this active lol.
^
muir chat hasnt had a msg in
uh
wait where tf is it
oh right
The man with my writers reference appears
<a:ohohoho:636686946734964786>
6 months
hey
<:fingerguns:654792913917837313>
i msged you to pick it up
My fault I know
before the quarter ended
smh
I wasn't around
Not that I needed it
Or maybe I did
making out as if it was my fault smhmh
Guess I'll find out
making it out*
i just use an ugly pdf version of it
so yall finishing up your last drafts?
Yes
i never got any peer review requests from either of you :P
how was mcwp 50
I'm about to proofread it so non neuro/cogs people understand anything I wrote
lmao
Boring
oH, for the visual element, do you *need* to cite a source of how u made it? or if it's completely ur own idea, do you even need a citation?
uh
Either
i think either way you need to cite something
like, they want you to at least incorporate the main source somehow
My TA said it was ok not to if you fabricated it
o ok
even if only in the caption for some explanation
From 'general knowledge'
bc i literally didn't use any source material
Or expected knowledge on a topic
i just was like drew cylinders in google drawing
Theres zero way for me to cite anything for mine
lol
Mine is terrible
And made in Publisher
id say more if i could see it
lmao
Without the caption mine makes not sense at all
i made a chart in google drawing too
bc i get that for graphs and stuff you need to cite the data, right
like, a branch chart or whatever
but I just did like a lil drawing
But I can send the terrible zoomed out version
Yes
so that doesn't require any citation right? bc... what would i even cite...
Nobody I know did charts or graphs
Mostly because we aren't doing data synthesis
well for my branch chart for instance, i basically had some typical "how media (might) incorporate disability"
then i gave examples at the end of each branch
Oh mine is much simpler and dumber
and then in the caption i would mention how, like from one source, certain approaches might be more "narrative prosthesis"
well the drawing itself probably doesnt need citing
thats the thing
I dare you to try and understand my overview

lmao
uh
course topic?
Uhhh
Cognitive Systems
i hope you explained your chart in the caption <:monkaS:442185930867081218>
mine is cyborg ecologies and im writing about trees :))
well its like this
Oh
My MCWP topicx
Is also Cyborg Ecologies
you wouldnt have a visual element that you CANT use in your paper
I saw the readings on mushrooms and things
And decided to double down on cogs
so if you can tie it to a topic in your paper, you can tie a source to the visual element in the caption
you have about 3 lines to work with for your caption
shorter the better for that tho
Yeah I have a 3 line caption
And I also take a couple of lines in the paper to set the scene
is "cognizer" a term you can cite?
Yup
And I do
In the uh
*background*
A HUGE part of this paper is the background
ye
984 words of background
In fact
about 4 pages <:yeet:442868651792793601>
well if yall want me to check your papers over, id be happy to, otherwise good luc
k
I'm in it for the P/NP really
lmao
Its the class I've kind of ignored for 8 weeks
i guess youre fine then
oof
how tho
mcwp50 is built with like, constant checkpoints
Spend an hour or two on the various checkpoints
i just want the A...
Easy enough
lol
As long as I get an A or A+ in my other 4 classes
oh right they probly dont mandate attendance this time huh
Its all good
Oh I went to every lecture anyway
I like my TA
He kul
huh
well thats not ignoring it then lmao
I never miss lecture
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
showing up was part of participation grade im p sure for my ta
and he required webcams on
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
Oh wow
Mine didn't
ah, im a little surprised they did that this time what with online and corona
We had two students that couldn't attend at all
Because of time differences
the muir writing department is a kinda bs smh

<@!268824350826692611>  gl w college apps~ if u ever need me for em esp common app i gotchu!!!
yes
jkdfjfasd;jkf ty
im sure ill be here panicking and asking for help a lot <:xd:612726759846051861>
common app was literally the death of me<:PEPESCREAM:466446495747670027>
mom says start in summer
so
soon
eek
I somehow killed the common apps
kinda scared ngl
yeah just like start thinking abt what u wanna write abt
are you gonna do early action apps
I can't write essays
maybe a couple
but I can write stories
^
ok i‚Äôm Jus Sayin
so I made really good common apps
my stories are a lot better than my essays
once I got them checked
:0
imagine
ur burnout is gonna be a lot earlier LOLOLOL
just write your stories
not writing your college apps
and then get
yeah
bc that‚Äôs what happened to me
3 days
before they're due
someone to professionally check it
jenny-
hoping i make one i want then i dont have to do the winter ones <:xd:612726759846051861>
ok but like
I didn't apply until the night before
im kinda scared cuz
so
i did a bunch of sumemr program apps
I also didn't SIR until the last hour
this past winter/spring
omg
like 9?
8?
something like that
2 got no response, i assume canceled or rejected
1 waitlist -> accepted
and the rest rejections xddd
be that
so now im kinda
worried
because
essay bad
you got 1 accepted and waitlist
:(
so thats really good
ye
a lot of people get none
after 20
yeah thats why i did so many
i was originally only applying for 2
aand then
it turned into 12
then i cut it to whatever i ended up doing
yee good mentality
always over apply
was the easiest one that i got into
ended up not doing it
cuz it was supposed to be like
lab work and lectures
but now its online
and $2500
for 2 weeks
so
oh lord
mom said not worth
yeah no
not at all
so now im just doing summer college classes yeehaw
doin some cs and bio
oo
thats really good prep
I was smol brain and lazy
so I never did that
lmao
parents leaerned from stoof
told me to tryhard earlier
MOOD
good idea
its like ah yes your brothers were great
but they could've done better
my parents didn't know anything about college
you need to be better
so ive been doing some summer classes every year
and summer program last summer
both my elder brothers went to community college
ah
and dropped out
so when they heard UCs
they were like whats that
oof
it took until the middle of last year aka sophmore year
for them to really understand college
Imagine doing common app lol
but my little brother is a little shitter and is barely completing adult school because he did really bad in HS
And yes I've been revived <@268824350826692611>
he's finally turning around
but it took him way too long
he's def not going to college he thinks its useless
oh damn
wb chris :)
I feel that, I'm scared of messing up, both my siblings went to ucs so me not going was going to be a death sentence
^
Good thing I got in <:pepecry:712987584976125952>
yeah my parents are like

good morning gamerz

that was yesterday :////
do you know people in the class that went diana <:PES_SadHug:622403182252916756>
yeeee
i got lucky bc he recorded it but at the same time it's like "when tf am i gonna actually watch it"
me for any lecture
good morning tritons
<a:ohohoho:636686946734964786>
tht's trash pandas to u
JKKFJDKJ
i saw that confessions post abt changing the mascot from king triton to sun god
raccoon mascot is valid
however i love our chad mascot too much
chAD MASCOT FSKJG
it would be pretty dope if we were known as ucsd sun gods
however
other schools wish their mascot could have washboard abs like king triton
i think sd beats all the other mascots in the uc system tbqh
like 3 schools have bears as their mascots
<a:aPES_Sleep:513527329738194954>
one has. A BANANA SLUG
AHAHAH ok i like the banana slug because at least it's kinda funny
it's p memey but compared to tritons OOF
anteater
<:peterS:699397578877435975>
also we have a cute handgesture
you mean the west side one?
jkjk
or the white power one?
even ucsf has a bear mascot liek WH AT
what even is our mascot, king triton? sun god? racoons? CS dungeon kids?
tht's the multifacetedness of ucsd: you canbe whatever the hell u wna be
http://www.isthisathingpodcast.com/mascotreviews/university-of-california-mascots-ranked
I heard king triton has an 8 pack. That king triton is shredded
this was a fun read
they are trying to get rid of the gaucho
be less racist or something
How is the anteater first place
Daddi oski is #1 in my heart <:uwudaddy:606017963308613636>
king triton looks funny
i wanted to take a picture with king triton this year at triton day but alas <a:pensivebear:523313966097891328>
king triton with his gigachad muscles should be #1
i actually thought the gaucho was kinda cool
my brother went there though so im a lil biased i guess
I think Tritons is actually the coolest mascot out of all of them, especially in name
Like cmon bro, it‚Äôs a Triton
*banana slug intensifies*
:3
Nah
LOOL
A slug can‚Äôt beat a literal god
/s

i have a question for everyone hehe
yo
what are your ~thoughts~ on height in a partner
no important at all
is that just bc like you don't care LOL
yeah lol
AND SORRY IM NOT TRYING TO SOUND RUDE i just wanted a diff perspective
no thats exactly it lol
I don't really care for it
i feel like ppl talk abt big height differences being cute but also like i think there's cute moments with any variation in height including no difference
mine's tall but idrc
but it's nice to stuff my face on his chest <:kirblush:613942747224604702>
> i feel like ppl talk abt big height differences being cute but also like i think there's cute moments with any variation in height including no difference
<@!245736329382461440> yes
shorter than u they can wear ur sweater. taller than u then u wear their sweaters. same height wear each other's sweaters
me agree
my most honest answer: if i date a guy and he's my height or above i don't mind. personally it's rlly nice to have someone taller so i can feel cute and be lil spoon more TBQH. if he's an inch shorter than me, than ok, i wouldn't rlly be attracted to any guy i have to look down at

idm girls of any height
> it's rlly nice to have someone taller so i can feel cute and be lil spoon more TBQH
felt that
> idm girls of any height

felt THAT
but nina we know thats not the case for me AHAHHA but nah nah idrc
sandy tol
<:pepesit:694447186879971401>
Snadu too tol
not too tol
cant have too tol
not too tol
but bumble match is same height
if the guy is discouraged by the fact tht i prefer ppl who are taller than me, i will not hold tht against him. i wouldn't want them to get with me in the first place bc there are other ppl who wouldn't judge em based on their height who would be more fit for them
and like literally all my life i was like " nu i need someone taller than me " so dis new for me
yeah tru
wear heels assert dominance
OK FA
X
2 inch soles
heels hort
imagine wearing heels
2 inch NAH NAH NAH
more
dont have to imagine
STILETTOS
everyone is taller than me so i do not mind any height
like imma be clear yes there r short kings but if it's a huge difference i just. wouldn't be interested
D A G G E R H E E L S
oh lordy lol
i think my tallest heels are like 3 1/2 or 4
> like imma be clear yes there r short kings but if it's a huge difference i just. wouldn't be interested
<@!286708165612011531> same
<:MonkaSnug:633819928062984192>
my highest heels are like 3 inches too
wait wat
yall the first test of my relationship was when i had to walk from pc to warren in heels and i called him to bring me some flippity flops bc i couldnt get farther than sac
it do be nice to make eye contact with someone my height tho. it's like "hahai don't gotta crane my neck to see u"

4" heels only make me 5'0

Fuck this evening was a billion heart attacks
So much was due
Tuesday is the next heart attack day thanks to MCWP and my other writing class
> chiming in to say that boi do i hate college writing
<@!662123516656877588> I second this
According to my own genetics professor's grade calculator, I need a minimum of 57% on the final to get an A- and that seems super not right
how well did you do in the rest of the class?
and how much weight does the final hold?
It's a bit complicated the grading scheme, but the final is either 30% or 15% and the rest being covered by the homework. For the rest of the grades, they're mainly 95%+
With a midterm score like that it's a bit suspicious.
it be like that sometimes
for my ceng class, he sent out matlab functions for us to calculate our grades
and if I just dont take the final I get an A
this isn't how I thought the end of the world would look like if im honest

you should get real ID automatically if you did it within the last 2 years

I have an A- rn and the final was made no-fault
<:sweat:713285695694831647>
in that case I feel as though ive you've been over studying and stressing you should tone it down and realize that you're at a good point and you should focus on what you know and really study that rather than trying to learn something new, because it can only make your grade better
if thats not the case and you're just stressing because its a final
that makes sense
and I have that a lot
I finished doing the practice exam <:sweat:713285695694831647>
Ngl the first half had me struggling
And ty for ur advice miggy <@!198581553834622977> <:pepeOK:490384227729408000>
npnp, did the second half feel easier or easy ?
Like ez clap
The second half was just derivations of the hw
if so focus on that, and grasp it then focus on the first half but dont throw all your resource into learning it but like casually practice it and if you get it you get it, if you don't you don't and if you have the motivation look into it later and actually learn it on your own time
rather than just throwing all of your energy in a burst
because then you will only learn it for a bit
good morning gamerzz

YES
yes*
we have discord lecture
our students begged him
he is a cs professor tho
prob a little more comfortable with exploring
hmmm
That‚Äôs kinda Pog
<a:pepeFAST:650248098483929108>
well our only other option
at my school
with licensing is webex
and mics cannot be adjusted on webex
so we really couldn't hear him
we could hear every single thing he clciked tho
(we also have zoom for my school, but ran out of licenses)
he could have used twitch or discord, but discord is so great
he answers dms and i feel a little bad bc it's not always during class days
he just sees s/t and responds, so communication is rly good
but yaaaa discord live lectures
<:bigbrain:650505958107119616>
Time to do that for my di/oh

Where did you get it <@!198581553834622977>
gweetar center
ooo
theres only in san marcos
theres one*
I used to go a lot as a kid
Online? :o
because we would get strings for my violin and my brothers guitar
there
oooo
we also went for my Drum set there
and yes Nathan online
ah yes going for violin string, i think the only reason i knew about guitar center was because every time something happened in our orchestra, my teacher would just tell us to go there and buy/fix it
yeah im honestly surprised its still alive
but I mean props to them
I want to learn badly since my ex played :(
I just had a random burst to learn an instrument
and guitar called to me
well I played guitar before to help my brother play songs
<:banzai:442185100273123328>
but I never actually learned it

I was going to go for a $400 one but it was sold out
üëÄ
$400 <:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>

i was playing a valorant and i was so dizzy that i was like did the game end yet? <:kek:490008924414803968>
I want to eventually record and I didn't want something that didn't sound crisp

my liver prob hates me
did you buy the battle pass btw, miggy?
yeah being drunk increases somethings by ruining other things
a long time ago lol
oo ok
I bought stuff in Beta
dom told me to buy it bc it was only $10
so I had 17k creds
but im like uh
ooo nice
if you're playing this much
$10 is worth
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
hmmm
idk im just trying not to spend any more money bc i just paid my credit card bill for my pc
and it kinda hurt my soul and bank account
I guess yeah thats a good way
but im dum
so I would still do it
ü§î

the tool they give
its really nice

becasue it pulls it out evenly
so no need to be scared
yeah i saw the tool
mmk
well if i ever find motivation
to actually
do it
xd
I did mine immediately
honestly you don't need the tool but it does make it better to use
because I like having custom keyboard
yuh your keyboard has very nice keycaps
if you're taking out a bunch you want the tool
hmm theres no arm rest though
hopefully
my wrists
cause it hurts your fingers
üëÄ
don't fuck themselves
üëÄ
if you use your keyboard sideways you dont need rest
sideways?
so sideways
yeah
but like
which side does in
right side goes towards you or left side goes towards you üëÄ
i think its right side goes towards you
ü§î
> right side goes towards you or left side goes towards you üëÄ
<@!446932571192819713> the age old question

<@!580246928596664321> thoughts on ben-ezra final
?
<:widethink:440237377664057353>
did u finish
Midterm easier than final
i didnt finish a part of a question
9b
I‚Äôll just leave it at that
u think theres gna be a curve
like
Idk
looking at my answers again i think worst case would prolly be a B
It depends on the averages
but idk if i did better or worse than avg
apparently the midterm avg was like 80%
and i was higher than avg but not enough to get curved to an a
Considering that we just finished the final the grades wont be out this quick
and idk how people p/np'ing will affect his decision to curve or not
i don't think giving like extra time on a final that was longer/harder than it should've been is a valid accomodation
considering prof um's class gets 24 hours
and i think someone said sth ab another 20e section having no-harm final
The exam wasnt made any harder or longer
i feel like the time pressure was worse than the mt
but idk if thats jus bc i was burnt out on math by the time 8am rolled around
Prob
For me i was able to finish the exam in one hour and thirty mintes
So i started just **checking bac and forth**
i took the full 4 and didnt finish lol
neither did my friends
so idk
KAJDKAKSKAKSJS
HI WICHAWD

my friend literally pnp'd during the final lmfao
<:xd:612726759846051861>

<:widethink:440237377664057353>

üôÇ
i mean ik some people finished but for me and everyone else i know
Lol
they didnt
ik someone got an extra hour
also im so fucking annoyed by people
**honest system amirite**
that text me
asking for helop
during finals
like
bro
im doing the same final
Same
stop
give them bad info
Like ik we‚Äôre on the same boat
But damn
like u got kicked out of workshop for not showing up
üòÑ
why r u asking for help rn
The exam is literally open notes
**look at textbook examples if u rly dont get it**
yea
i looked at notes pdf's
and hw
but i havent like rlly slept since like
the weekend?
so my brain was so fried for the final
Oof
haha xd
Yeah kinda same
I chugged coffee for once in a while
<:sweat:713285695694831647>
i lowkey lived off caffeine pills but past a certain point i dont rlly need
caffeine
like u know how during an allnighter ur tired 1-4am then after that
ur just good to go
for the rest of the day
Yeah
yea
After the exam i ate my lunch
like i napped on monday for a bit but i wasnt even tired for last nights allnighter
And head straight to bed
same haha
i jus woke up
at like
8pm
Got myself 8-9hr sleep
<:pepeOK:490384227729408000>
moooood
im jus scared that like
theres no more mathematically clueless ppl in 20e
like there was in 20a-c
to pad the curve
if that makes sense
Lol
so i could very well be
the dumbest person in the class
i am mathematically clueless in 20e
üôÇ
Ok ngl tho if u alr made it to 20e chances r you‚Äôre not that dumb
<:xd:612726759846051861>
u have 24 hours to be clueless :)
man
thats true üôÇ
im dumb as fuck
its just that
in test environments i can do kinda ok
Like u **survived thru that calculus**
like 20a i showed up late to the final without a cheatsheet bc i didnt realize

No if there was it'd be more noticeable
But I am blind
maybe its my phone
There's nothing wrong.
The phone's weird.
bc it isnt weird on my laptop
KEK
I know there‚Äôs like a glitch in some names
Where it looks like there‚Äôs a space
I have an actual space though.
My falling leaves are a bit off.

There‚Äôs a space
<@!198581553834622977>
pls help
My name always have trouble with the bot that deals with badges
?
no enough space
<:yeet:442868651792793601>
try it now
yay
ty
I took out unnecessary space
yall the past few days i felt like
Smthn was missing <:FeelsBadMan:441463646124507136>
and then it hit me that
My mom never returned my other blankie after washing it
And i normally always have at least 2 blankies
Has she stolen it for her own uses?
<:FeelsBadMan:441463646124507136>
no she put it away bc she said i was psychotic for using two winter blankets in the heat
<:peepocry:640363747990306827>
lmao
the blankies hide the sadness
my bed feels BARREN
is this wat loss is like
<:pepehands:464568955533524992>
Blankies help a lot with sadness. It's been my substitute for human interaction for years now <:kek:490008924414803968>
But now it's tearing apart <:pepehands:464568955533524992>
I think I need to buy a weighted blanket for sleep
No this is loss 
| ||
|| |_
thonk
<a:surprisekms:639732940263260190>
i dont use blanket for weight i use bc it soft
it where my limbs go
<:kirblush:613942747224604702>
n then my head go on plushies
pillows dont exist
this is super random but anyone who looks at sokka and says "i don't like him bc he doesn't have powers" is an actual weiner
anyway
carry on
*hides my twelve pillows*
He's smart.
Bbut Sokka is a weiner
And a weiner.
XD
the more i look at it the more i want my desk
<:peepocry:640363747990306827>
it wont look aesthetically pleasing but itd be so efficient
<:pepehands:464568955533524992>
id actually never have to get out of bed again
Other than to pee
sokka is a frat bro at heart but im glad he got the misogyny slapped out of him
he is now frat boi with heart of gold
frat guys scare me bc they come in packs
THEY DO
Anyone who comes in packs scare me
what abt. puppers
Im wildly afraid of middle schoolers
puppers r ok
humans in packs r not
omg do u know tht one mulaney joke
where he's like
yo middle schoolers come in sets of like 20 and it makes me genuinely terrified
like i could fight one of them but 20????
if i see a grp of 13 yr olds on the other end of the sidewalk i will cross the street bc i do not want to cross a bunch of middle schoolers
middle schoolers r the meanest ppl in the world
they havent developed a sense of empathy
but they know mean shit
<:pepehands:464568955533524992>
him: they'll make fun of me and say sth like "LOOK AT THAT MAN he's got F EM I N IN E hips!" and i'll go STOOOOP I'M THE MOST INSECURE ABOUT THAAAAT
oh indeed they do
tiny little monsters
Indeed
pre teens in packs
<a:hahakek:676470025317777484>
if i see more than two middle schoolers approach me i will cry
high schoolers r not as bad bc they learn empathy
but they also travel in packs
So they r also not ok
but only like juniors n seniors r ok
sophomores r kinda arrogant ngl...... like idk y....
i think
people are scary in general
üôÇ
freshmen r just middle schoolers w more power
<:pepehands:464568955533524992>
tru
^ case proven
right there
ik bc i was a freshman and i was an asshole
same
o
lmao
LMAOO
wait im still an asshole
Freshman yr me deadass physically kicked a few seniors when the teacher wasnt looking <:pepeOK:490384227729408000>
makes sense
the tiny people usually the worst
<:kek:490008924414803968>
its just a big child
they were being annoying n purposefully blocking me
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
so i went *ANGOR*
i still do not have empathy but like at least i understand social norms slightly now
<:kek:490008924414803968>
i am still a ball of angor
but now i am a silent ball of angor
lowkey middle school me only collected plushies to use as projectiles for when someone tried to enter the room and wake me up
_wake me up_
WAKE ME UP INSIDE
CANT WAKE UP <:cryangry:606031757099401217>

I have one no fault final with a secured A, I should be able to sleep right ? Cause less stress but I just can‚Äôt find it in myself to be able to sleep the past 2 days REEE
Same for me but I have something to actually worry about and my motivation has never been lower.
I hate sleep
Like why can‚Äôt I just fucking go into bed and sleep like a fucking normal person
i feel that
<:pain:713285895419330591>
I didn't get any sleep yesterday night
and im having so much trouble rn
so like yay sleepless nights
at least this has made me want to clean out my subscription list on youtube
crazy to see how much effort someone put into creating their channel and then also how fast they disappeared and you forget about them
the internet is scary
i havent been able to fall asleep yet and my dad just woke up to go to work
<:WRONGHOLE:713286884972953662>
:(
bro I legit saw the sun go up and down twice
:(((
it aint healthy but Ive been trying to fix but the stress anf angor from that I think makes it worse
i feel you
<:pepehands:464568955533524992>
i've been watching this harvard psychiatrist  who stream on twitch
and he made a valid point that I think probably is affecting me
I think too much and have too many unresolved things I think about subconsciously
that keep me up
when I try to sleep
and i need to meditate and do this exercise to complete those un-completed thoughts
quite understandable bc it's one of the only times youre left with your thoughts
so that I can relieve myself of the internal anxiety and stress I have
but its hord
<:PepeHands:504520804466163732>
i rooting for you miggy
also our generation has skyrocketed mental health to an all time high
we now have more patients with mental health issues than people with cancer and many other prominent illnesses
its crazy
oh boy
most of the patients are people in college :) or in our age range
ig in a way thats good but also having mental health issues might just become a trend that people exploit :(((
hopefully not a lot
but it also means that there's more people that we can relate to and find comfort in
yeah this quarantine isnt helping me at all but I went with Christine and two other friends to eat today
and I felt so relieved and happy
yay!!!
very nice very nice
I am starved of human contact and the feeling of love that it's made me such a depressed little shitter who only complains and is sad
maybe thats a little harsh to say about myself
but its true
:(((
being by myself leads me to think not so bueno thoughts
hopefully summer will treat you better
maybe, I got summer classes so thatll keep me busy hopefully but tbh I said that about this qtr and it did not work
im just hoping once my guitar arrives it helps me destress
ooooooo
also didn't mean to drop all this on you Dino but I just thought I had to get it out or else it would drive me nuts, thanks for listening <3
it's np! dw about it!!
is it weird that sometirms
i am hear to listen
also dont feel obligated to answer
I forget mental health exists
tes
yes
das bad
oop
oH
imo
i do too
ok its not jsut me LMAOO
you get too engrossed in something else to care about yourself
me
me
100% me
or like something stresses you out so much that you dont care about the stress just about getting it done
@ me today with my final
life hard
it is
too many things to care about
yes
I be cri right now because im like I need to start caring about myself more but its hord when all my life i've been the rock that everyone has gone to and looked to for comfort and support
but I feel so broken down
but I know I can't help everyone all the time
and thats whats making me stressed
that I know I can't but I still do it anyways
wait hold on i saw a tik tok about this
let me find it
omg diana LMAOOO mood
But yuh i get u miggy
sometimes u jus gotta
not care abt other ppl
well I wouldn't say that
but def put yourself as prio
like ill just nap or watch shit and not look at my phone for like 4 hrs at a time
cw: dark imagery
https://vm.tiktok.com/oVuqa6/
you see I would Wendy
but I get sad when I have no one to talk to
o idk then
My natural state is alone preferably asleep
my life is a mess
ahh but you see sleep is hord
or else I would sleep too
sleep v hard
sleep either super ez or super hard
No in between
uh
When i used to not sleep wat id do to rest is just lay there w eyes closed
sleep has only been super hard for the past year
It dorsnt help u falla sleep imo
but it like
the reason why im awake is bc ive been on tik tok for the past two hours
Made me feel like more rested
also dino that is def how Im feeling
and i missed my sleep window
ty for sharing
yeeee
npnp
I mean alone time doesnt needa come from sleep
U can be alone but w someone
i felt slightly attacked when the algorithm showed it to me
Like camming while watching shit
I wanna be in calls with people but most people I vibe with are super busy with finals and other stuff
and I value their success more than my emotions so I do not pester
although many people say its not a big deal when it comes to wanting to help
I still can't take it upon myself to take peoples time
from studying
im in calls all the time <:kek:490008924414803968> if ur stupid as shit and rely on OH to fix ur code then ull be on call 6 hrs a day trust
<:kek:490008924414803968>
I mean
but thats not the calls I need
If ur all camming but doing ur own stuff
u wouldnt be taking time away
its like studying together in cv
i kinda know how you feel miggy bc i am very much a group studier aka my best studying is done in group settings
yall spend time tgthr but still productive
so i compromised by camping vc
mm I see
people are still there to hang out and bond over the music
i study best alone at 4am bc thats when my brain turns on
ngl the only person who joins me in VC is Randy, bless that man
randy op
caitlin and alex say im only big brained in my sleep or at 4am
so I get sad
when no one joins
and so I tend to not do it as much
when r ur vcs
i haven't done it in a while
i go to OHs til like 7 normally and then sometimes there 9-10:30 OH
but I used to do it from like 6-11pm most of the time
but then ik the ta so we fuck around until 2am
just imo music is a lot easier to do bc it doesnt require talking and people can just jam and share their favs
no thats what it is
i'll hop into conrad
but im sure once summer starts up people will have more time
and queue some music
did it for like 2 weeks straight and Randy and maybe charles were the ones who joined
sometimes jenny for like a sec
aight miggy i gotchu next time
im just trying to be open with my feelings rn
idk im pretty sure a few ppl on discord prefer studying in groups so maybe u cna hold a discord study thing and yall can zoom n see each other
so that they dont cloud up my mind
itll be cute
n hopefully productive
I try but people have their own groups
already
so its hard to make something happen
like study groups?
Im sure theres some ppl who r just chilling w/o a study group
most likely but i've tried a couple times none really successful
its just hard when you study different things
<:peepocry:640363747990306827>
<:thonk:440231969796784128>
Meanwhile I'm doing a drug deal
cool
A wild fongers has appeared
MY DAD IS ACTUALLY LEAVING FOR WORK RN
yeah
WTF
when I was at home
I would see my dad leave for work at 4am too
he kind of just says hi now
instead of telling me to go to sleep
because he knows
big facts
i hide
My mom sees me up at 6am and doesnt question whether i slept or not anymore
mostly bc she sees me passed out at 9pm for my daily napnap
idk I just haven't found my group yet
i think
im going to take it as my queue to try to sleep <:peepocry:640363747990306827>
okie gn dino <3
gn!!
i'll come back in a couple of hours
wishing you the best
wishing you the best
i'll prob still be here
tbh
gn!!!
do u have any friends in the classes ur taking rn who‚Äôd be down to study n chill
I mean yall dont rly needa be studying the same thing imo
I haven't found anyone i've connected with
But idk bc i dont call ppl to study
people are very different
in my major
i msg caitlin n alex at most but thats abt it
o
Wym different
like their interests, hobbies, how they study, how we conversate, I haven't found anyone in my major that I vibe with and can talk to
like dont get me wrong i've made friends because some of us end up taking the same classes
but we only vibe in class
o i get u
me in hs KEK
yeah
so I just haven't found my group
and i've been trying
the group I had
graduated
and all live out of state or are working somewhere else
yea study groups r hard to find bc its typically a quarterly thing
so they don't have the time anymore
hnless yall need smae classes
or have similar schedules for multiple qtrs in general
I also find it hard
to
conversate with people
without constantly
hanging out with them
for example, I try and keep conversations with Yen now but I feel like sometimes im trying to find things to say
and nothing comes naturally
and thats because I strive on experiences and finding out how people feel by seeing how they react and carry themselves in person
but with quarantine
I have no idea
because text
doesn't really
amplify anything
ima be honest i just dont rly msg ppl so idk how to help w that LMAOO
its okay
im not asking for help
I just spew things
to get them off my mind
just know when I ask for help, I will say it
but i mean tbh if u wana converse but duno how to get it going id say jus shoot ur shot
send a meme or some shit
thats wat i do
I used to be really good at it in middle school
now idk I just kinda lost it all
i feel like a lot of ppl r a lot better socially in middle school lmaoo
i used to be rly good w fast paced group environments
well yeah you gave less of a shit
about anything
now i get tired afte rhanging out for like 20 mins
now you're too fucking warry of everything you do
well at least I think I am
I hate that I know all these things about myself
and I know I can fix them
but I don't
and I try to but fail
and keep trying
some things fix w time
Its ok to let it fix itself slowly
like idk ig the best example i can think of is maturity
like u can know that ur immature but
U cant just fix it just bc u want to
u jus gotta grow w timeeee
n das okkk
yeah im just a hypocrite because I tell that to people all the time
that things go slow
and it takes time
but its just hard to put it to practice for yourself
because you're your own biggest critic
I know the solution to my problem is literally like you said to just stop giving a shit
yea it can be frustrating when u arent changing as fast as ud like
but when thats all you've done for the past 10years of your life
its hard to shake off
compare urself to where u originally started and not where u wana be
that might help
bc ull notice changes
n ull focus on how uve changed as opposed to what u need to change
possibly
I don't really know where I started so its hard to do that but I've def given that some tthought here and there
never a considerable amount
but I have
if u duno where u started just choose a random earlier time KEK
bc it probably means its smthn thst happens as u grow
Like 13 yr old u vs u now
when i duno i typically choose preteen yrs bc i feel like preteen vs now is when u can see the most growth bc its like ur lowest pt LMAOO
i've actually gotten worse from when I was 13 to now
i was living life
at 13
o well i was yikies at 13 so
now im depressed and an insomniac
oop
that was like 14 yo me
<:kek:490008924414803968>
but i mean
Ig just estimate a time
where u started to care and try to fix it
and then how u r rn
> where u started to care and try to fix it
<@!262847360403636224>  pls explain, by fix you mean ?
actually hold on to that thought
go finish your hw and studying for your final
I know you have a lot on your plate
like ig just start making an effort towards addressing it
i mean
I have two no risk finals i didnt study for
But im alrdy at an A- for both classes
My main concern rn  is 140L but i cant do anything til OH bc im super stuck on the code
and OH is at 9
might nap til then
good idea
my brain is exhausted
from all the emotions
maybe itll help u nap
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
when im mentally tired i jus nap for like 4 hrs
key word "i'm"
you
I can't do that
maybe jus lay in bed n close eyes to help u feel rested at least if u cant sleep
I did that earlier
it helped me get energy back when i used to not sleep
o
miguel I FEEEEEEL U
thats why im up
rn
my guy
<:scrunchthink:440232169919610880>
I‚Äôm sleepless and fucking sad af

that professor is a blessing and a demon
i said yesssssssssssss
lmao I wouldve said the same
with no hesitation
ya he was also asking
if anyone else i am taking is doing no fault

most
and that was good enough for him

do i give up on a final
and just do p/np
wats ur grade in the class
~~yes~~
uh so it works by a point system
currently i have 75 points
I feel like a lot of people are doing that right now jeff
i need to get 5 points on a final to get a B
B-
How many points is it worth
^
fianl i think is total 35 points
i mean can you cheese 5 points on it?
yes
pnp
when your prof has to give you a pep talkk
be free
so realistically i only need 15 points to get an A-
oh wait
waitgo for it
15 points ez
so ur telling me
you only need a 50% to get an a-?
you got it
just take it
u need an F to get an A-
bruh
less than 50% actually
just do it
and then count the points you know you got
<:kek:490008924414803968> **you need an F to get an A-**
but this test uses so much brain power
my final is 15 points and i need all of them to get an A- <:pepehands:464568955533524992>
and decide a grading based on that
you're not using your brain for anything else anyway üôä
you only need so much brain power to get an F
üëÄ
I mean if we only use 10% of our brain at all times
can provide loaner brain I dont need mine till fall
rates vary
you only need 4% of it to get an A
can i borrow your brain
i have
the 10% rule is BS
uh
nothing
<:kek:490008924414803968>
low low price of
to offer
well shit
wait wait
i can
wheres my valorant boosts
i will stream 1 valorant game for you <:kek:490008924414803968>

<:kek:490008924414803968>

i can not turn in my final essay and be fine

<:pepehands:464568955533524992>
its okay 105 is where it gets fun
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
why is 105 just ass class in all depts
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
whats 105 in aero eng
wait no 105 is actually pretty interesting
i enjoyed it
**fluids**
jk idk
105 in mae is math TWO
they took math
<:thonk:440231969796784128>
and they made everything infinite
and doubled it??
and I cried
oh
inf^inf?
nah but basically its
PDEs
and fourier shit
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
105 is taking heat and spreading it across an infinitely llong thin pole
or tube lol
then calculating the heat as it spreads
105 told me that basically everything is infinite and nothing matters, least of all my grade
practically
ohhh want to carry me in my fourier analysis class
woah woah woah
ANALYSIS
i feel like half my class is about to switch to p/np and just give up on the final since everyone has 100% on hw and matlab
foruier transforms are soo hard
slow your roll there cowboy
I just know what they are
never said I knew WHY they are
damn thats a mood tomer

triton weak af as well
only people that can are kages sun bot and whoever <@&642811673945833522> is
give it to me
i can't
i don't have enough power to give you more power than i have
sun god bot has power?
we can make that happen then
yea
but i rather give the power to moon god
<@!433774411682938890> can we give moon god the same power as sun god?
but wai
so moon god can snap me

i did this for lab3 too
F
im p gud at debugging via waveform now
but lab3 only took 3 hrs so
we do that too but lke
i dont think ours look as crazy

its like you meet
500 new people
ahh gotta love the orientation friends
and week 0 friends
mhm
there for a second gone the next
imagine being allowed outside the house
don't forget
class friends
quarter friends
I made a couple in my freshman year engineering classes
mhm
2 of the three of us dropped engineering lol
i ended up really clicking with one of my friends from one of my classes
and since we're both cs
we ended up being in a lot of classes together
and they were really good friends with their roommates so i just became the 4th roommate
üôÇ
Lol nice nice
are you going to move back on campus next year if oyu can?
maybe i did a lot of stupid shit during middle school lol
i peaked in hs lets gooooo
i peaked when i was born
it be downhill since then
i never hit my peak, i hit a plateu somewhere early on
uh prob not moving back to campus
fall quarter, for sure not going back
if i need to come back, i might get an off campus with some friends or jsut commute
damn that sux lol
my life sucks
My life blows
i was about to make that joke
Ur mum made u
The biggest joke
i think i peaked in 5th grade bc i rmbr extremely enjoying life and school when i was like 10
also lots of reading
^
My life is in a false vacuum state
tfw i read one book a day from 4th grade to 6th grade
"omg i'm peaking"
when i was a kid i wanted to travel the world and as a 20 year old i play geoguessr instead üíØ
I peaked towards the end of my career in a place all the time
I think i am at stable rock bottom
hey richard thats traveling in a sense
But it sinks deeper and everything goes to shit
i think i rock bottom'd spring qtr of freshman yr and mentally/academically its been up from there
like no matter what happens it is literally impossible for me to be in a worse place than freshman year
even considering remote learning
like !!!! imagine being constantly happy for an entire yr-- tht was 5th grade
that was me like
jr yr hs
when i felt confident ab my future
My life plateaued 2 inches above rock bottom and has been there for 2 years
I have lost the ability to feel
on the bright side once u hit rock bottom u can only do better and better
u kno?
False vacuum state
I think im on the up swing right now?
lowkey dunno wht a vaccuum st8 is
electroswing, rands?

||b00bz||
U think ur at the bottom but ur not
i think rockbttming is sth tht feels worse reminiscing on, in my experience
i think a lot of it is realizing u cannot be worse off than u were
I love electroswing ninob
tits
blue tits
saggy tits
I would love a pair of tits
like when u look back and yr like holy shit i was a horrible human being
oh i didnt need to censor then
I tend to do that
i am a terrible being
I am terrible
that was junior yr, nina was a toxic lil gremlin
but its not looking back, its realizing im kinda a shitty person right now
ooooo yess tht too
junior yr nina wasnt bad
elementary and middle school me was mute <:sad_dab:613867302701760542>
at least not to meeeeee
and high school me was annoying
I was an incel in freshman hs but thats over with now
Kekw
and now i'm depressed
I'm still thinking im kind of a chameleon outside of the internet
thanks dino, she was p bad tho, and not the good kinda bad
Who what where when why did UCSD change summer session to in person
<a:PEPESCREAM:659115134089822288>
?
wtf
wait what?
no fuckin way
no?
Everything i'm looking at is in person now
<a:PEPESCREAM:659115134089822288>
why would they change it all of a sudden?
üß¢
> but its not looking back, its realizing im kinda a shitty person right now
<@!213151486434082817> 
thank god ur self-aware, tht's the first step to change
They sure as hell didn't tell me my two classes were in person
<:cursecat:612044490307272727>
They changed since I looked a week ago
One of my fall classes went in person too
it still says all classes will be remote
<:gun2:607557159768686592>
I know

webreg says
irl
but im pretty sure
^
its still gna be online
all my classes are remote, but i aint tryna live at home for the rest of the yera
They changed today
Or a few days ago
I'm gonna advising
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
i think ppl have to deal with their faults and realize them in order to get a headstart in personal growth; the worst is when ppl point them out to me and i'm like, ignorant of my faults. which is needed sometimes but still sux  jdfjkdhgjdhgdfjlgdhfjlg

yea relax
I was shook because they removed the online disclaimer and added all in person classes
I think i need someone to beat the shit out of me, to help with my faults lol
<:cursecat:612044490307272727> I'm dropping my fall class though
sam
what the FUCK mine r inperson now
r u doing cse20 / cse12/15l
?
esp cse12 in fall
summer session?
im trynna find ppl
for tht
CSE 12 and 15 in the fall yes
lets gooo
staff?
Gary and Gary
<a:ohohoho:636686946734964786>
I believe
<:gary:433451558676594688>
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
> I was shook because they removed the online disclaimer and added all in person classes
<@181482518107783168> im peeved idk if these were predetermined locations b4 covid but
jk gary made 15l final multiple choice this quarter
gary is for the kids

ripp
also
isnt it the same content anyways
cuz ik for 11 niema and the other prof
They could have avoided a heart attack by not changing them to the in person locations
had the same content
Gary wrote it so yes
yeah probably
yea sam lets grind this fall
<a:PepePopcorn:554328145344462848>
i thought it's always been in their in person locations
Wait they are gonna make the professors record it in person aren't they
for summer session
im prolly gonna be mainly prioritizing cse classes bc i feel like its more worth for this
In case people *want* to go
bc i feel like i wont do well in certain other classes no matter what
meanwhile
and some classes r ez
> i thought it's always been in their in person locations
<@!405810391025713156> Not when a little while ago monkas
It changed back so I died
i coudlve sworn
rclas was a fall enrollment thing
and it always had classrooms
?
rclas is for fall
yea
exactky
nah sam i saw rclas for both ss
my schedule is still online for falllllll
ur not tripping
^
rip the mulah
like which class
The classroom listing have all changed too
At least compared to when I enrolled
I guess its just whatever
Its sitll online
yea
i feel like in a dream world where zoom doesnt drop me from sessions all the time
and lectures are like live twitch streams where u can pause / skip to live
online wouldnt be that bad
like idk why u cant rewind zoom ...
> like idk why u cant rewind zoom ...
<@!595010202613317632> This is why professors should set them up as Zoom semianrs
yea
i feel like the idea of a "zoom meeting" doesnt make sense
when its one person talking to 400
Zoom Seminars are literally a thing too
Or at least they were
~~tfw you know you have no impulse control so you shouldn't crave alc so much bc you don't ever want to blackout or grow a dependency but mmm spicy water yummy and makes me less of me for a few hrs~~
Fun fact: Addiction and/or dependency has a genetic risk factor :)
:)))))))))
isn't it funny how my mom jokingly offered me alc and it was my dad that said no she's gonna be an alcoholic
~~and he's the alcoholic of the fam~~
i mean what
> Fun fact: Addiction and/or dependency has a genetic risk factor :)
<@!186011132325003264> thank u neuro major hmmm my mom can't handle alc and my dad isn't a big alc person unless it's a fam reunion
What's a father figure? <:hyperstears:713286532441833492>
aha!
haha
discord zoom event: grp therapy and aa meeting
except we're all alcoholics and it's not anonymous
howEVER
i need therapy
i think i have a proclivity to get hooked on things easily
therefore
i should not indulge in drinking as much as i want to
My biological father is a bit of an alcoholic and the male person who lives in the house now makes it not ideal to go anywhere downstairs starting at 7PM.
therefore
<a:kyokothumbsup:593493208382832641>
no rushing, *ever*
haha! gotta love abusive households
/s
It builds character.
i used to think i was at an acceptable level of alcoholism but over the past qtr my friends living across the square in argo sent enough "one year ago today" snaps to b a yikes
when we get back were going to do exactly that dion
me: *trying not to turn this into trauma porn
also me: i have inherited so many horrible things and i would like to d*e
dino and nina
yes
I miss the magical first year moments living in Revelle. There was never a dull night.
no questions
wait thats a thing
revelle was gr8
trauma ... porn?
Atlantis representing <:hypers:471374617337135134>
oh wait revelle was very interesting for me
> It builds character.
<@!186011132325003264> i wish i didn't have to build a personality off of being abused, tho, that would've been nice
argo terra lounge >>
mmmm
> trauma ... porn?
<@!493178993814798346> yeah like, for example when ppl rt traumatic or graphic content and go OMG... this is so sad.. thots n prayers
OOH
ohhhhhhh
and like argo hall, was like the home of goon shit in revelle
or when ppl like, are like, "well MY childhood was more fucked up than YOURS"
at least for my year
like some kind of trauma olympics
Ooh i see
stewart hall ftwwwww
douglas can suck my ass
fuck douglas
and its powdery ass ceiling
you mean the asbestos ceilings?
5am alarms????? every week?????????
argo > blake i will rep argo & terra lounge forever
There's a certain peculiar solace in just openly talking about it with people who *gets* it and making it a trauma olympics sometimes. If it's in good taste, which it seldom is.
Douglas is the sad part of Warren.
revelle was nice
Revelle is where the party's at. Remember that clipboard at the top of the Keeling Apartments? I miss that little thing.
> There's a certain peculiar solace in just openly talking about it with people who *gets* it and making it a trauma olympics sometimes. If it's in good taste, which it seldom is.
<@!186011132325003264> i understand but it makes me pissed off when it becomes tellingly performative
i never lived in keeling :((
I believe theres a certain time and place for them,
i never lived in keeling either
keeling rooftop is so fkn nice
keeling is soo nice
but then again, we r all performers, pot calling kettle blk, yada yada
i spent some time there over ss2 2019
but i've been passed out in keeling
kinda cold though
the worlds a stage
oo i once did an impromptu on tht
whats an impromtu?
Sometimes I would go to the 10th floor and out the staircase overlooking Revelle and just sit there undisturbed.
wait were you a theater kid nina?
No one ever goes there and you make lots of friends with random birds.
I did that with the keeling garden
extempt speech kids r fuckin scary nina pls tell me u didnt do that
The apartment building closest to the parking lot is nasty though. The staircase there has a worrying amount of dead bees.
Walking around rimac forest was also super calming
there was one thing i hoped to never be in my life and that's a theater kid
i am my own one-woman disaster impromptu show
OOH i see
it was for decathlon
I was a drama kid, but a techie never an actor
ooh
actually I was an actor once for a very small part
we get to choose from 3 topics during speech comp, have a minute to deliberate what to say, and then answer it in 1:30 to 2 minutes
along with a prepared 3:30 to 4 min speech
I realized then that drama kids were as ||horny or hornier|| than band kids
> extemp speech kids r fuckin scary nina pls tell me u didnt do that
<@!595010202613317632> que es extemp

~~It's not sex it's ERP~~
<@!286708165612011531> u get given a topic w zero prep, u prep a speech on the spot, u pop off on tht topic
it was part of the show you right
terrified of anyone who can pop off on any topic at 5 mins' notice esp. when debate kids spent like ... 1-2 months on each resolution
im done... like actually done
it wasn't as extreme as tht but yes, along tht vein
we weren't supposed to use props but one girl came in yoga clothes and her yoga mat
for her prepped speech i assumed
which would dock her attire and general pts but who cares that was 5 years ago holy SHIT im old
sometimes i think ab like the terror of fucking up during a debate round and how little it matters 3 yrs later
hs seems so long ago
times were simpler
simp this simp that jus take me back to SIMPler times

im trying to write something in <#656357040406396958> but i cant articulate it and its frustrating
It's okay to not be able to articulate things sometimes
Much of what makes life wonderful and horrible is impossible to perfectly put into words
i usually dont have this problem so its frustrating
im going to try to autopilot it
If you really can't get it out, try posting one sentence at a time.
have you tried articulating
thanks
you're welcome

Anyone know how to wire computers?
wire??
he means like assemble it
theres a lot of good youtube videos that tell you how to do it, wilson
they'll be like, "this wire that looks like this, goes into this"
then you do that about 10 times and pray it works

how do i block someone on messenger bc they keep flexing their boba on me?
is it jeff
no
jk LMAOO uh
~~i already have jeff blocked~~
i mean what
<:kek:490008924414803968>
<:kek:490008924414803968>
assert ur dominance by judging their choice of drink and boba store
happy lemon D:
when they send u a pic/order be like ‚Äúahh regular milk tea from happy lemon? 4/10 choice bc happy lemon is known for their cheese foam. Thats like ordering viet coffee at a whitewashed boba shop.‚Äù
idfk LMAOO
LMAO
who hurt you
if u keep criticizing their choices theyll leave u alone
:^)
no one hurt me im just a cold blooded person at heart
understandable
Yeah Wendy ain‚Äôt give no fucks
I wish I had that mentality
imagine having fucks to give
i am actually the least fav child bc im the meanest
oop
LMAOO
Cheese does not belong in boba tea.
cheese foam kinda weird too mee
to me*
i was gna say smthn mean but then i realized nathan hasnt done anything to me
oop
LMAOO
üëº
cheese foam makes it creamy which is only a certain occasions kinda thing for me
bc i prefer a more tea-like milk tea
which is y happy lemon isnt as appealing to me
like its good but
its a certain occassions vibe
bc most of their drinks feel more creamy
fair enough, im not the biggest fan of happy lemon either, it good but not my first choice. I think cheese foam throws me off cause its mroe salty than i expect
salty? <:yeet:442868651792793601>
It's pretty salty.
like me
waddup gamers
:3
we love salty gamers lol
Yeah i htink the chees foam is salty
it jus tastes creamy to me idk
i see i see
I dont think it particularly salty but I usually mix it into my drink :3
It just tastes unhealthy.
I also prefer the puff cream
^
puff cream though
and in general I just rarely get happy lemon LOL
also a mood
I don't really understand that big hype of happy lemon
I think its solid but it's like <:GWcmeisterPeepoShrug:403295315685539852>
if im driving out  to convo for boba im probably not hitting up happy lemon
yea tru
unless it past 11
cuz happy lemon closes the latest LOL
most other places close before or by 11
yeah thats the only shitty part lol
i want to get their puff waffle thing

<:PES_Hmmm:652091181983072266>
lmfao
wow we have a hacker

> wht exactly is provost honors 0:
<@!286708165612011531> provost honors is 3.5+ gpa for the quarter!!
hacker mans
ooo oki
Its legit honor roll for college
time to make tht the next academic goal
<@!286708165612011531>
this is for revelle but i think its similar for every college
why talk about provost honours when you can stress about latin honours?
<:nyello:441469558423814144>
cum
laude?
im not even gonna THINk about those
too much work and stress
***SUMMA*** cum laude
I got provost honors a few times tbh didnt feel very honored
latin honors scares me
i would literally explode
> i only have 2 A's <:kek:490008924414803968>
<@!405810391025713156>  I only have one lol and it‚Äôs in anthropology <:kek:490008924414803968>
my aunt was a summa and i cant live up to her expectations
(for people in cogs18 how exactly do code tests work)
<:pepehands:464568955533524992>
my mom works with a doctor that went to ucsd who was magma cum laude i think
ah yess
I'm not getting latin honors
lmao
same
> my mom works with a doctor that went to ucsd who was magma cum laude i think
<@!667622934537306112> very pog <:pepepoog:606017447623131166>
thats insane
god tier
he crazy
he cray cray
did you know
No
I didnt
just relaxed that they‚Äôre not pushing me to get latin honors
ok wilson
I was going to type
it
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
I was just kidding
What do i know miggy?
Tell me
there's this psychiatrist that went to Harvard and got his phd by only studying 2 hours a day and he put his method in such a good way
He compared it to a dirty lake
I feel like thats pretty doable tho
you cant think and retain info
2 hours a day isnt bad
lemme search up the reqs for getting ucsd latin honors
if the lake is moving to much because that moves the dirt
My attention spans like 2 min
and so things arent clear
so if you can calm the lake (your mind)
i just googled it and now my head hurts
things will become more clear
and easier to retain
so learning becomes easier
Tbh this quarter my mind aint no lake its a straight up rapid
But yea i see what you mean
Bc you see things more clearly when you calm
Thats why yall should practice mindfulness
Take like 10 min to just do nothing and observe your thoughts
<@!242544930528952321> u just write ur own asserts
Like separate yourself from your mind and just observe the flow of consciousness if that makes sense
im pretty sure u can literally do ```python assert type(something) == int``` and that counts as a test
yes it been scientifically proven that meditating helps improve GPA
and we only need two of those??
<@!595010202613317632> welcome back!
hi
Yea i used to meditate
ty
!
my eyes
are starting to unfocus
and give me headaches
felt tht shit
i wanna as,jdfbwkeyfblsadjfwbaefiiuadkjs
im literally about to glue my eyes shut
for the next 3 weeks
until ss1
or have an iv drip of eye drops into my eyes
imma join you in that
just stop seeing
go rest, dino
D:
im alr basically blind
i passed out earlier
david i think we need tests for 2 functions, not 2 asserts total
and i didnt know
but idk
but the tests can just be like 1-2 of those asserts yes
> im literally about to glue my eyes shut
<@!595010202613317632> lemme help u with tht
yea just have ur asserts for 2 sep functions
i just did assert type == int / str for 2 functions and im calling it a day
i need a 60% on the final for an a
^
or something like that
like idc
o
i should
calculate my grade
yoyoyoo we graduated just now
hope yall are doing fine w finals
there's an assignment she put that's supposed to be your current grade
it's grade before proj
congrats sands!!
o yea
good job sandy uwu
congrats Sandy!! <:banzai:442185100273123328>
but im like what do i need to keep an A in the class...,
is the A cutoff 95%\
wait isnt it a 93
Its a 95??
i thought 93
no i have no idea what it is i was asking LMAO
Idk i just assume 93 bc thats typical
i have not checked anything for this class in so long
it's not specified in the syllabus
^
I only pretend this class exists on days we have tests
o
so is pytest just a way to do all your asserts at once?
piazza post maybe?
*pain*
o i meant for the grade cutoff
> I only pretend this class exists on days we have tests
<@!262847360403636224> MOOD
But uh
yes pytest is for unit testing
I had two total test function w/ multipel asserts
The class avg is super high tho so
Idk wat an A would be
hmm
Are yall gna piazza post or should i
<@!286708165612011531> thank u for ur assistance! im glad ur always so helpful and forthcoming w ur support
yeehaw im done w cogs18 forever now
<@!262847360403636224> im pretty sure an a would be a 93 right
question
where do we like
run the pytest
separate file
```python
from [ur file name] import *
```
file in same directory
then if u had a function deez_nuts that's supposed to return the integer 5
oh so we have to make a test file
or like notebook
```python
assert type(deez_nuts(whatever)) == int
assert deez_nuts(whatever) == 5
```
i think separate file
so
a .py file?
yea

i didnt have a scripts folder
i had it like

project
- project.py
- test.py
notebook.ipynb
requirements.txt

Thirty fucking two percent. I give up from this school, I really do.

All that fucking hard work for nothing. The overall experience is absolute trash but I thought, maybe, the reputation would save it but just look at that shit. 1 in 3. What the fuck. That's middle america tier. Just let anyone in! Worked hard? Come on in! Did you work just a bit more than usual? Come on in!

I got fucking regents, they bought me the fuck out, but fuck this I should have gone to USC or UCLA and just take the L on the debt. All the sacrifices I made for prestige and money: working extremely hard for 1530 SAT, giving up social life, giving up a dream school atmosphere and experience all for fucking nothing, all absolutely out the fucking window. When anyone can get in like this what's the point in working so hard to pull yourself out of the herd? Any fucking dumbass can make it in here. I am fucking done with this place.

I'm going to be obsessed just to get post-graduate work so I can erase this embarrassment from my life.

If this was your "target" school and you made it in, congrats, but just to let you know as you have realized: you're not very ambitious and you settled for very little.

What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little peasant? I‚Äôll have you know I rank top of my guild in World of Warcraft, and I‚Äôve been involved in numerous secret raids on LoL and I have over 300 confirmed games on Steam. I am trained in MLG 360 scope warfare and I‚Äôm the top sniper in the entire TF2 universe. You are nothing to me but just another n006. I will snipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before in this game, craft my fucking hats. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being hacked right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your steam account. You‚Äôre fucking hacked, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred games, and that‚Äôs just with my old Xbox controller. Not only am I extensively trained in melee combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Orange Box and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little ‚Äúclever‚Äù comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn‚Äôt, you didn‚Äôt, and now you‚Äôre paying the price for the fite me irl DLC, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You‚Äôre fucking dead, kiddo.

i was scared of my TAs too
but they're honestly really chill
theyre so fkn chill
i promise we dont bite
idk about cs TAs or OHs but sometimes I just go to hangout and see what other people need help on
the other day i was testing my code in front of the ta and i wrote "i hate this lab i want to die"
and he just laughed at me
we had something that i really liked in cse12
since were online n the instructors didnt want us falling behind we all got assigned 1 ta
who was your prof?
on it anderooooo
every week wed do a little interview about the stuff that was covered the week prior
verifying
i confused every single TA with my code except for 1
cao/allos
and thats bc that 1 TA i was actually scared of
n didnt go to his OH

you didnt have *gary*
so basically i got to know at least 1 ta
WELCOMEEE

OH hits differently

tbh idk how ive made it this far
one of my TAs was like *are u and ur group even on the same page for this project*
<:Pepesad:601573092992745472>
and i was like <:kek:490008924414803968>
i dont go to oh for any other classes except for my major though
if it makes u feel better ive never been to OH until literally 3 weeks ago
dont you

other than my own -/-
i feel like once uve established n accepted the fact ur stupid
n u just go to oh
theyll eventually be like
"theyre kinda stupid but they try ig"
trust me if u go to 2 OH in a row they will like u
^
i like people who go to my SI session
i like ppl who go to my oh xd
andrew if i go to ur oh will u like me enough to do my dishes
theres si for cs?
no i do si for math
but point is
ah
ppl will like u if u attend their sessions/oh
!!!
bc u keep them company
and if there arent a bunch of people there you could even talk about other things
i was lowkey scared of my prof but then i went to his oh bc my code was broken and he started with *so which part of it is bitching at u*
and i was like *oh*
i once talked to my TA about anything from where he got his rings to what his research group was doing
what the
who was that
thats hilarious

is mot hai ba
it means "sometimes the hardest and best part of loving someone is seeing what extents they will go to in order to prove how much they love you"
nah im kidding it means "one two three DRINK UP BITCH"
<:thonk:440231969796784128>

i was like
thats so wrong

<:cryangry:606031757099401217>
the second part means "i am a bigass puto"
and the middle part means "ur the cutest little shit"
*yo soy una puta* <:wotthink:441465363671154698>
that was probably highly incorrect
but the sentiment is there
If we‚Äôre talking tagalog it just means you‚Äôre a really big puto, or seeet bread lol
I gave up I‚Äôm just lying in be now
IM A REALLY BIG BREAD
<:bulbaowo:615441070033207307>

We like big bread lol
how do i say that
how do i say *i am big bread*
Ako ang malaking pandesal
i like big bread n i cannot lie
At least that‚Äôs kinda how it is in tagalog
you'd think people would have moved out already
but i still see a shit ton of people parked on justice
lane
But pandesal is a specific type of bread
Ooh I wonder if there‚Äôs a lot of cool free stuff

<:yeet:442868651792793601>
instead of waking up like two hours early you can just wake up ten mins before class
shihwen
i wake up at 2pm
u literally
eat
after waking up
its just that
<:kek:490008924414803968>
u wake up at diff times
breaking your fast
and multiple times
doesnt matter what time of day it is
richard seems like he has a bad sleeping schedule <:thonk:440231969796784128>
if u nap after every meal
I break my fast all the time
ur next meal will always be breakfast
so u can literally only eat breakfast
so i only eat breakfast
yea
<:wuh:440237146998046730>
spittin facts
nick my sleep schedule is gr8
the most important meal of the day üòå shih wen choosing wisley
even during finals week
my sleep schedule was a solid 12-8
except that
it was 12pm-8pm
i-
LMAOO
ME
nah but jk usually i sleep around 12-1 and wake up around 8-9
or like 7:30
but i go back to sleep depending on if i have an 8am or not
my sleep schedule was 8-3 bc of nick at the beginning of the qtr
But i fixed it to 4-2
thank god 8am cogs18 is done now
<:kek:490008924414803968>
so u just slept 3 more hours
thats not an adjustment thats an addendum
nosleeping at 8pm and 4am hits differbelty
o
i mean im fully trynna destroy my sleep schedule over summer session
cuz
im tryna
do well
i get brain crlls starting at 3am ish
3am - 6am if u leave me alone i can finish a whole PA if i tried
same but my room doesnt have good shades as opposed to ucsd shades
so like
sleeping at 10 and waking up at 4 is the perfect timeframe
üòå
i wake up at 7-9am bc its bright
nick ur like a grandpa
r u only able to sleep in the dark
yea lowkey
oof
jus gotta stab my eyes out
also when its dead silent
so ive been sleeping w my earbuds in
when i do that my earbuds are scattered to the ends of my room when i wake up üòî
yea every mornign i hvae to like look everywhere for my airpods
y wear airpods to sleep
funny bc i usually use wired earbuds when im at my desk and i only rlly use my airpods when i sleep
do u share a room
bc noise cancelling
no but sometimes theres noise
like ... the more silent the better
o
noise makes it easier to sleep
just sleep last in the family and itll be quiet <:kek:490008924414803968>
white noise is ok
like lofi
just tune it out üòå
fall qtr
my dorm
window
directly faced
r u saying u couldnt fall asleep in lecture
the gliderport street
right
so ppl would always fuckin
whip out of there full blast
at 3am
like bro stop
<@!87652481768620032> i said white noise was ok
i always fall asleep in lecture  <:FeelsBadMan:441463646124507136>
oh wait ur fake revelle <:feelsBadMan:581433505754382336>

or 107a in ss1

<:juri:585580175014756375> the only cogs class i've taken so far is 10
jk idk when im taking it
i'm doin 14a in fall oof
i might drop cogs 100 in the fall tbh
bc
im taking 19 units
i-
dont do that
<:Pepe_MonkaChrist:612363181318209562>
Wheres the problem
<:kek:490008924414803968>
and i feel like cse12+15l, math 180a, cogs 100, chin10am might b rouhg
this quarter was basically taking 16 units for me
i did 20 this qtr
but i p/np'd a class
considering i didnt think about cogs 10 until the midterm
i regret not taking hum 5
but
12 and 15L relatively low effort imo
i wish i tried harder and letter'd the 5th
ok but heres the thing
i did jack shit in my cse 11 equiv
o
15L is pure memorization
ok so wat im hearing is
ur willing to help me
ty
!!!!
basically doesnt exist til midterm
or final
do u need cse11 for cse12
bold of u to think i have a memory
like am i
entirely fucked
uh
if i dont remem anything from 11
I mean the knowing how to code in java part
Thats abt it
if i know the extent of how to do cogs18 content in java
will i b ok
or should i like
study cse11 a lil to b ready
12 is easier PAs that focus more on understanding data structures theyll teach
If i rmb correctly
o ok bet
i think im gna end up taking cse21+30 next yr too
if i can
i mean idk bc idk wat we learned in cogs18
LMAOO
tbh idk either
i think there was important stuff at the end
and also a5
idk what a5 was
you'll be fine for cse 12
i never opened it
all you really need to know is how to write in a java syntax
and you'll literally be fine
ok bet
i just need like
a- avg
u might needa know recursion
idr
from cse12 to 30
some PAs ive done past 8b used recursion
or b+
i didn't have to use recursion for any of my PAs i think
in fact
paul cao said
for the screening
NO recursion
LOL
if i subject myself to all of this
and dont get in via lottery
im gna be so
tilt
o then idk
I rmb using recursion for like maybe one cse12 PA
is the class
gna be
pa-heavy
or test-heavy
PA probably
ok bet
im willing to die over pa's but i hate exams soo much
but idk
Depends on prof
But most coding classes ive done have like a good 40% of the grade minimum be PAs
yea that was my cse 11 class
same w cogs 18 i think ?
in cse100 our midterm + final = 20% of grade
bc 15% final + 35% assignments
o wtf
<:wotthink:441465363671154698>
its nice bc i got like a 54% on the final LMAOOO
and like a 60% in midterm
<:kek:490008924414803968>
honestly ull b ok even if ur not gr8 w coding
Theres hella tutor lab hours
ok bet
!

And i was like <:huh:442185049870434307>

I cant tell if its a joke or not but ik for a fact my aunt does work in developing lotions and shit

LMAOO
Depends on store tho, typically i say ‚Äúless creamer‚Äù and theyll know to put less milk or watever
The specific location i went to called it ‚Äúmore tea‚Äù tho so

<@!254873393113858048>
Python is the devil's programming language
pyhton really is psuedo cod
python for loops ü§¢
isnt there like no syntax for python
Python in general is gross
i mean obviously there is
but it's ass
Just give me statically typed variables :(
Then again I only know python
<:kek:490008924414803968>
v a R
So I can‚Äôt say much
About other languages
No, Java has `var` and it's awesome
Actually I barely know python
i will give it to python that it is aesthetically pleasing bc ur forced to have proper spacing
u saying python is gross when u only know python says something LOL
and it doesnt use shit like
***node
It says that
I hate coding
Eew node
ok fair python indenting
n u t
scratch best language change my mind
who needs indenation
matlab or bust
Node is worse than python
python
python can just indent this ass
oh wait
<:MonkaS:478989594457538572>

factual
<:thowonking:712569034209493042>
Imagine coding for a living
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
so many CS majors
and lara is the only one with a worthy
cs major
imagine coding
couldnt be me
same
This is why I‚Äôm not real cs
i dont know how to code
what's a language?
I can‚Äôt code
i think its a semicolon??
but idk
do you like to code? -jeff
no, i dont
get away from me
LMAO
I like coding
Idk why
i dont mind coding
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
If I was big brain enough
coding is ok until its not
I would like it more
true shih wen
Whenever I get shit to work
idk if i can say i love it or anything but i def prefer doing PAs over like hw for GE classes
That‚Äôs when I like it
coding is ok until 5/6 TAs tell u they duno wats wrong w ur code
<:pepehands:464568955533524992>
That's prolly accurate
<:PES_F:647744696172412929>
F shih wen LMAO
yea i pref PAs over other hw assignments
my debugging is op tho
Tfw I had a ta help me for a wholeass afternoon and he had no idea what was wrong
sysout "bruh"
And he realized I just spelled variables wrong
LOL
sysout"fucking bitch"
and then i know where the error is
yooo
i did like 3 couts
print "yeet"
for cse100 pa
print ‚Äúkill me‚Äù
and alex spent the whole day tryna figure out y our code was significantly slowe
r
"bitch 1" "bitch2"
and it was bc of the couts
that just said shit like
STONKS
LOL
too much stonks
cout<<"kms"<<endl;
bitch = ‚ÄúLara‚Äù
That‚Äôs all I can do
whos that bitch laura

i got knocked in 8b for a bad variablename
LMAO
I‚Äôm too small brained for cs
they were like "use meaningful variables"
cause i left yeet as a variable
LOL
for a delete method
lmaooooo
cant believe they accused "bruh" of being not meaningful
rude
bruh1 bruh2
HONESTLY
it tells yall a lot smh
like about my mental state
fr tho
<:pepeClown:708511148265177209>
beep boop beep boop
maybe we should report the graders to caps for making our mental state worse for saying our variables werent meaningful
<:FeelsBadMan:441463646124507136>
why am i talking abt cs outside of school ew
This is school
coding was ok... until i got to verilog
huh looks like all the cs majors came out to play
and then nothing made sense anymore

Tru. Idk I‚Äôm just in mira Mesa/ SD running errands with my parents and wanna get some boba <:pepehands:464568955533524992> ü•∫
more tea flavor go for r&b or gotcha, more creamy is more like ootea and camellia rd
sigh i think i've effectively tried all the super popular boba places in SD
just get half & half
<:kek:490008924414803968>
half n half is so hit and miss for me
half n half? <:wuh:440237146998046730>
guess i never miss
I hate andruwu
There‚Äôs no half n half in SD i think üôÉ
dabs in north oc
I normally go for ootea‚Äôs jasmine milk tea
I want 7leaves üò¢
or dingtea bc its generally a safe option
dabs in irvine
Ah I‚Äôve never been to ootea
but idk wats good at sd so
Ty andrew
yw
7leaves line too long
~~fuck you~~ ty andrew*
bc it has drivethru
There‚Äôs diff 7leaves
the one near my place is p good at keeping lines short
i dont like 7leaves bc its too milky
Its like ok
But its too milky
And i prefer tea like
shih wen wants _tea_
<:wuh:440237146998046730>
üëÄ
get 7leaves cuz its better
you can also never go wrong with some 85
<:Pepe_MonkaChrist:612363181318209562>
üß¢
I would get 7leaves but I went to SD. Imma get happy lemon  bc I‚Äôm basic
dont listen to nick he doesnt have standards
<@!595010202613317632> 
Two of the ten hw assignments will be counted as extra credit if u did all of them
Hence you only need eight out of ten hw assignments to be completed for full credit
drive üôÇ
When‚Äôs the deadline for grades?

I want happy lemon <:pepehands:464568955533524992>

What
You had me in the first half
Not gonna lie
xd

<:AnimeInsane:615441328720838656>
oh no
this is probably untrue but it used big numbers and therefore proves my point
so i will use it anyways
I
unfortunately i was not one of the 11 children killed by the bus for the past 19 years
Those are pretty good numbers
And now i am spreading misinformation
By those numbers a school bus is a lot safer than driving yourself
<a:ohohoho:636686946734964786>
any other driver driving is a lot safer than driving myself
i ran into my house before
i-
to be fair it was a large target
very easy to hit

:^)
shes also a liar
She once told me ‚Äúold water‚Äù doesnt exist
üò§üò§
*fake news*
people who say all water tastes the same don't drink enough water
^ amen
The taste changes after a few hours
haha jokes i dont know anything yet bc first year crim is legit high school
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
Criminology
what I do know is that I would arrest anyone who says all water tastes the same

arrowhead
arrowhead is nasty
lucas arrest <@!173261056225837056>
arrowhead is not nasty
costco vibesss
costco is life
COSTCO
<:wuh:440237146998046730>
people love costco primarily bc its cheap to buy bulk
But tbh
water from this thing
Costcos main appral to me
crisp
Is the fact that i can go out once to buy snacks
And then not have to leave the house for like a month
LMFAOO
tru
i never drank water from that thing
quarantine vibes
i dont trust the fuckers at my school
same, shih wen
brought my own water bottle
mmm love the taste of lead
:^)
caitlin was one of them
god i hated her ass in hs
good
LMAOO
i didnt like majority of them either
>:^(
snakes
ok ms. screams at 8am bc she sees her friend
yeeee
annoying snake ass
fite fite fite
if u werent so loud at buttfuck oclock i might have tolerated u
kiss kiss kiss
i keep my enemies closest
:^)
is that y u hang out w me
nah youre low priority
and low maintenance
*yall she called me low maintenance*
i literally
just have to cook
and let you sleep
someone remember that for when she calls me a needy bitch
that sounds pretty low maintenance
fuck arrowhead squad pulling up
i dare u to tell my mom im low maintenance
<:kek:490008924414803968>
shes gna be like <:huh:442185049870434307> ur friends w stupid ppl
low maintenance to me
bet
shes gna tell u to gather n wash all my cups for 19 yrs
<:kek:490008924414803968>
my moms so tired of cups
im p sure shes told any parent that knows of me
<:FeelsBadMan:441463646124507136>
the other day i went to daiso and asked her for more cups bc we kept running out bc i hoard cups and then she got mad at me <:peepocry:640363747990306827>
LMFAO
this conv
kirkland water is the best water
^^
thank you
do yall rmb those fancy ass water bottles
With the pH level of the water on it
i rmb seeing them at costco
uhh
And i was like
we‚Äôre at costco wat kind of bougie ass-
probably?
<:huh:442185049870434307>
> kirkland water is the best water
<@!405810391025713156> <@!583681872480174091>  agrees with this
i have the memory of a goldfish
<:yeet:442868651792793601>
i don't drink arrowhead
what about dasani
what's y'alls opinion
That‚Äôs nasty water.
its ok
i don't rmbr much of it
dasani kinda hits for me
yeah same
agreed, fuck arrowhead water D:
but shits expensive
Dasani is so nasty that the entirely of the UK hate it.
idk its nasty to me
my mum drinks alkaline and fiji only
i think i bought a bottle at disneyland one time
Citation needed :^)
idk why
my water taste is basically not arrowhead
dasani is like the poor person‚Äôs splurge for ‚Äúgood‚Äù water
SAME
her stomach's super sensitive so she likes the Bougie worter
same, fongers
Dasani is coke without the coke
Bc arrowhead is too low quality
i can't believe arrowhead is on shelves
and ppl eat that shit up
the only thing good abt dasani was its water bottles werent loud as shit
Arrowhead is nasty. It‚Äôs cheap.
Arrowhead would always crinkle n shit
Dasani water bottles are not skimping on the plastic
> the only thing good abt dasani was its water bottles werent loud as shit
<@!262847360403636224> dasani if it were paper, would be laminated paper
wobble wobble
*laminated paper noises*
Meanwhile there‚Äôs this bottled water brand in Thailand that had such thin bottles that when you drink it it would crumble into halves
like it FEELs wavy
i havent drank that much dasani so idk
It‚Äôs to save on plastic which is cool but it was funny
i don't really have opinions on water brands except for kirkland because that's the water my fam always gets
and this other brand but i don't like that one
i forgot what it was called
i dont drink bottled water much anymore so idk
$3 for an entire pack of water <:PatrickGasm:600914637940326400>
ngl idm arrowhead like if there was arrowhead i'd drink it
but im very specific w filtered water
I grew up on bottled water and although it sucks that we‚Äôre using so many bottles and creating waste
ya i mean its still water it just sucks in comparison
My tastes are forever changed
no theyre light blue
")
we're all

Is bleach super sweet?
This person really telling me to drink bleach <a:sadshaky:670539217905909770>
yes
as long as it's clean
mhmm i love me a good tide pod as a snack then wash it down with some bleach
if u wont i will
i will either way
but u know
actually idk if i wana die drinking bleach

I saw it on supernatural and it looked like it hurt
Drinking bleach is not fun. It burns your oesophagus and tongue.
yuhh
i wana die by being put to sleep and then having doctors just take out my organs
have y'all had piss from the source
hit diff
Meaning it can damage your vocal chords and hinder your ability to taste until your tongue regenerates. A close friend of mine had to learn sign language and it hurts when she tries to talk so :))
donate it sell it do watever the fuck u want
You have to be healthy to be considered a donor, sorry.
but i wont be in a lot of pain bc ill be unconscious

it's 80%
yea

My roommate is from there
Imagine living in SD
I could never
Facts tbh
Ngl
Not a fan of SD for living
But visiting it is nice if you have somewhere that interests you to go to down there
What's wrong with living in SD?
Nothing
It's just not my preference
sd is lowkey perfect tbh
^^
I'm so sick of the city
whats 'the city'
the weather in socal is real nice
Until it's not
I guess cities in general
hi everyone
i am back
wat is good
ok lowkey not a huge fan of sd
everything feels far
like i gotta walk extra just to get boba
Eh
I don‚Äôt vibe with it the same way
I‚Äôm more of a norcal type of guy
Tho I‚Äôve lived in SoCal for basically 18/21 years of my life
I actually like the ability to walk everywhere
norcal is ass
sf is ok
Too cold for me
I completely disagree with that Richard, but it‚Äôs ok
To each their own
Also sac country is very warm
its not my thing bc it feels like endless suburbs
I wana have access to boba shops 5 mins away
And I prefer the colder weather anyway
not 50
<:FeelsBadMan:441463646124507136>
I loove the mountains and nature so
and jts still too hot here for my preference
It‚Äôs like heaven
ah
I don‚Äôt like beaches as much
half moon bay / big sur / portola valley/skyline is pretty
Even tho I live in a beach town with beach view
Lul
ok lowkey i dislike beaches bc i hate sand
it feels like it never rly goes away
like even after i shower i just like
I love beaches but I don't like the beaches in SD
Why is the water cold even near summer
???
idk
Can‚Äôt say I dislike the beach or anything, but that mountainous environment just makes me feel cozy and at home
sd beaches r pretty compared to la ones
In a way that this beach socal environment just doesn‚Äôt
long beach is disgusting
I‚Äôm in south OC so
ario move to adirondacks ny
Our beaches are very nice
They're pretty but I wanna swing in the ocean without freezing my ass off
Just not my main preference
But I didn‚Äôt have a choice in the matter, so it‚Äôs whatever
That‚Äôll be for when I‚Äôm financially INDEPENDENT
Yessir
Long Beach ew
Entitled ass feeling area
That‚Äôs more Newport Beach
LOL
But I like Newport for what it is
isnt long beach split 50/50
Area wise
like theres rly rich spots near beach and thats wat LB is known for
But like farther in theres poor areas
Long Beach is mid
long beach is upper mid class i think (?)
mid to upper mid
Literally any beach town in OC is better, and so are places like Manhattan Beach, Redondo Beach, Hermosa Beach, Malibu, etc
redondo is ok
its like
avg
It is, but still better than Long
Any is better than long beach
Was never that impressed with Long Beach
that shit is trashed
It‚Äôs mid
Wouldn‚Äôt say completely trash
its the most littered beach ive been on
Lmao
You never been to Zumba Beach?
In the valley
That‚Äôs the worst beach I‚Äôve ever been to
No i dont like going to beaches
We only went bc family friends
So we just went where they went
I‚Äôm not necessarily a beach person either, but yeah
Zumba Beach is ass
beaches r boring the sand is dirty and the water is salty
And I‚Äôve never been to a beach that literally had so many sharp rocks in the shallow region that just irritate the shit out of your feet
I mean, beaches have those, but Zumba just has a LOT
And it‚Äôs very plain and boring
i LOVE rocks <:wuh:440237146998046730>
but understandable
Even when they cut up your feet?
<:ppmmm:563574481054859269>
like small rocks??
Yeah like really small and sharp rocks
small rocks r nice bc u can throw them at people and not injure them enough for them to consider suing but it still hurts them
U slick bro
<:kek:490008924414803968>
<:kirblush:613942747224604702>
small n sharp good
LOL
<:ppkek:552775140740431875>
I saw that
nah but yea some beaches r more for view than for actual beach activities
not tryna get cuts all over my feet when i needa step on sand to leave
Yeah, but that‚Äôs the thing. Zumba Beach offers like literally nothing of value to me. It‚Äôs sites are mediocre and so are its activities
I would advise just going to Malibu if you‚Äôre ever looking for a good beach to go to in the valley
The backroads that lead up to it are very nice too even you enjoy driving like me
i *hate* driving but ill let mom know if she ever goes to beaches again
Man, why no one in here like cars
driving is boring u gotta stay awake the whole time <:FeelsBadMan:441463646124507136> while everyone else gets to sleep <:peepocry:640363747990306827>
Except for like one guy I talked to briefly
Matt loves cars
<:pepestare:700693046362112060>
Crazy
wait deadass if any of you get mcdonalds
if u mention a car he‚Äôll talk for hours
get a mcchicken and get a filletofish and combine the two
Just don‚Äôt do it in this chat
its the best sandwhich youll ever have
ok im done gn
<:yeet:442868651792793601>
big mac and extra sauce is all you need
that just sounds like two burgers u eat at the same time
jasper.....
like i only get bun or lettuce or meat
not at the same time
<:FeelsBadMan:441463646124507136>
nolstagia
i call it a burger depending on the bun tbh
so cross street after????
like sandwiches r a dif bun....
or sizzling pot
tht do sound good tho
actually thats true sandwiches use white bread or like loaved bread cut into slices while patty bunds are just a spherical bread cut in half
<@!286708165612011531> i want bonchon tyvm xdd
wack
WACK
<@!262847360403636224> wait so burgers are burgers based on the bun and now whats inbetween
TF U GET AT BONCHON EXCEPT BONES jkjkjkjk
BONCHON
i agree with this statement
yes
i needa retry it to get another feel for it
low key im a bigger fan of bonchon now than cross street
the bun is super important in the distinction
ok lowkey bonchon hella good but not worth its price
cause cross street tbh overseasons imo but thats just me xd
wait they have a new coronavirus deal now
wait bonchon?? they didnt have one when i went
<:yeet:442868651792793601>
the one in sd
o jk
(including tax)
they had like a store deal where it was like 25 dollars for 8 drumsticks or something like that
<@!286708165612011531>  u get soy garlic at bonchon xd
thats still expensive :^(
true but cross street is like 9 bucks for half a pound of wings
:')))))))))
i dont think ive ever been but idk
i dont normally eat at convoy bc overpriced
i just go home and demand caitlin make it tbh
o
*we have convoy at home*
LOL
> <@!286708165612011531>  u get soy garlic at bonchon xd

<@!143214977585643520> LMAOOOOOOO u valid tho

YESSS

dRY POY

o
Training for spicy food you just grow up with it

<:feelsglassesman:713649958154403850>
she stopped buying uh
the spicy sauce
Monkas

i mean shit is spicy and i cant stand but i still eat it
<@143214977585643520> YETTTTHHHHIRRR
Every trip to a restaurant in Austin Texas destroys yours body
its stockholm syndrome
They love their ghost peppers
My dad basically lived on the spiciest curry possible from a local restaurant when he was single, and then enforced that onto me.
~~TL:DR UK kind of ran on take out food for years~~
I always remember the local take out that was pretending to be an Indian restaurant but they were from Bangladesh. They also ran both a Chinese restaurant and Fish and Chip shop in the same building. *southern England in a nutshell*
o shit spicy curry??????
i love spicy curry
it hits differently
curry is like... one of those foods that just dont hit unless it spicy
CURRY WHERE
u get wat im sayin
<a:PEPESCREAM:659115134089822288>
Ye I do
But I hate when the spice is just bitter
I like me some complex spice
Which is how I end up driving to national city for some Lao food
Then again
<:pepehmm:520539005477978123>
I should just attack Matthews house
ok lowkey i do not like schezuan spice
i cant spell idk if thats right
but like
<@!314229461396488195> I‚Äôm gonna crash through your door with a G20, hope you don‚Äôt mind
<@!314229461396488195> I‚Äôm gonna crash through your door with a G20, hope you don‚Äôt mind
its too peppery
^ this
<a:PEPESCREAM:659115134089822288>
its like... its not even spicy its just abusing pepper to create similar effects............
You better bring the ingredients for whatever Lao food you want
<a:PEPESCREAM:659115134089822288>

Dammit
You have me
My mother gonna think I‚Äôm crazy
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
Why
Jumping from German to Texan to French to Chinese foods
Across the days
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
<a:ohohoho:636686946734964786>
I mean xinchen did the same shit
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
Fair point
I need to tell her the ways of the south
The key ingredient is cholesterol
And a heart attack
That won't work
She'll just chineseify it
Like she did your Texan ribs
And
The MSG should do the trick either way
<a:ohohoho:636686946734964786>
She really did though
I was shook
She touched it
And boom
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
Became a sweet savory Chinese dish
Instantly
She shall see real ribs
i think ive fucked up my sleep schedule again üò¨
yall still on a schedule?
wack
right
just don't sleep
What's sleep?

Lol it's cool to see another Garrett even if the spelling is different
Ye
Growing up I never had a name conflict with anyone else

throwback to math 31 <@345083648124649485>
math 31 <:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
throw back to jagler <@!210908400152870912>
Fuck that guy
lin alg is still my least favorite subject to this day
and jagler didnt help
F
F
how bad was lin alg in your opinion?
like the concepts, not the prof
we talking the 18 version or 31 version
whats the diff?
proofs vs computation
31 is 18 but with proofs
ew proofs
oh yikes
math 18 version then
can't wait to die in math 18
nah you got this, Lara
tbh the linear algebra part wasn't hard but the proofs part was awful
Math 18 isn‚Äôt that bad
It‚Äôs easier than 20 series
when in doubt
rref is out
Honestly lol
Like I felt like I didn‚Äôt really know what I was doing some of the time on the midterms, but then I just did rref and somehow ended up with a B
Like I felt like I didn‚Äôt really know what I was doing some of the time on the midterms, but then I just did rref and somehow ended up with a B
i'm bad at math tho
<:peepocry:640363747990306827>
The only computations you have to do in math 18 are basic arithmetic
Like first grade tier
^^
only problem is its so much
yikes
math18 is doable but honestly imo one of the classes u have to self study
bc i had one of the better profs for math18 and like
idk it just is a hard class to teach
Oh yeah you gotta actually study
Cause it‚Äôs a lot of vocab
just study like a week before midterm and ur good
I didn‚Äôt do that, and coronavirus saved me from having to take that final
i literally did not know wat linear independence was until a week before my final
and got out of that class w/ an A+
Would not have passed otherwise lmao
math18 is more on the conceptual side so u just have to work to understand the concepts
And then ur chillin
Understanding the concepts also just boils down to when to do rref
for proofs its lowkey just getting it down to one of the statements on the IMT and then being like ‚Äúby IMT....‚Äù

Hey can you guys help me out real quick? I need help debating my point
Can you taste cold? Yes or no
imo no bc cold is a sensation
however for artistic sake i can describe sth as tasting cold??? if tht makes sense
salads = a cold food
But water‚Äôs taste is dependent on it‚Äôs temperature
and will taste cold
hmmmmm rn it sounds like a q based upon semantics
like yeah id say sth tastes warm or hot or cold based on how much it was heated up
but i wouldn't use it as a way to describe the FLAVOR of the food
idk
You can walk to Malibu...
B R U U
cya at 820am.
i mean with cold versus hot you get more of a lack of taste versus more flavor
I said help me with an argument not side with the opposition
thats why cold sparkling water tastes better than warm
> I said help me with an argument not side with the opposition
<@583681872480174091> TF HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW WHT UR STANCE WAS YA DING D O N G
You should just know me
cold water tastes pointy, warm water tastes round
`but you def can't taste cold

üò† tip your waiters and drivers
i was tipped nothing on one of my doordash trips and now i will always tip my waiters/drivers
i always make sure to leave tips <:pepeOK:490384227729408000>
i feel so entitled saying that but then i realize its like, less than minimum wage if you leave no tips
ordering delivery already be so damn expensive <:pepehands:464568955533524992>
yeah
it really do be
yea its honestly really rough :((
i dont know how this business model is gonna work in the long run tbh
LOL
like grubhub and everything is so expensive as is but im p sure the pay to the actual driver is still shit af
so the driver gets $5 base on shortest deliveries
and usually thats like a 30 min total drive where i live
so yeah i got humbled
<@710939598364213348> yes that's the one
I always tip
my drivers
:) <3
<@201663427452731401> There's also the 9th one
Which do you prefer?
9th one

This one correct?
Yep
Arre
Send through email?
Sure. ssusanto@ucsd.edu
> üò† tip your waiters and drivers
<@433774411682938890> ^^^^^^^^^^
esp in azn restaurants where the food is super cheap, and it's "expected" to tip only 1 or 2 dollars which is barely a 10% tip sometimes
^^
super cheap restaurants are always more sus in terms of how much they pay their waiters/servers
wait youre doing doordash now irene?

my acc got sus and my life has been a void ever since
also
my math final got posted and

??? i am so confused
F
missed something somewhere D:
idk how an answer can b both correct and partially correct but who cares
correct answer but partially correct work?
^^
or like missed a part on the work that they wanted to see
oh tru tru
especially with math
missing steps or something
yee what jenny said
who cares that's literally 1% on the final so we chillin
or if its proofs, sometimes you write one wrong thing and its a point off
xd
ah you used k instead of h
rip
yeah you used rho instead of pi here
^^
**fuck**
or what ever other symbol that looks like a p
man i want some pumpkin pie
make some
im more of an apple pie kind of person
I have some pecan pie if that's a worthy substitute
i just want a pie
ooo never tried that
It's pretty good with ice cream ngl
ice cream <:PatrickGasm:600914637940326400>
best dessert
i h8 mixing up phi and theta bc i swear i do that every time w spherical coords at some points <@!213151486434082817>
real angsty moment when u realize halfway thru a problem
^^
i mean like if you know what youre working with then it doesn't really matter
yea tru
but like once youre in the field a computer will put it all in for you lol
seriously though we ran out of letters so we used the greek alphabet, then we ran out of greek alphabet and each character could mean multiple things in engineering
i want to say that im gna be in a field w nothing to do w math but i'm not even done w math in school yet
so rip
you got it though
yee
I just got my new driver‚Äôs license and I‚Äôm so ugly wjzjendnen

<@!345083648124649485> LOL i barely play anymore... used to be a habit i had in class / waiting at dining halls for food
could probably still beat the lot of us
<@!213151486434082817>  im part of the chess club‚Äôs discord server... should we invite the real players? ü•¥üòÇ

<@!324701936593141760> im still sad we never finished the set at envision we'll have to do it next year
chess hard
mood
same
yeah I definitely just like don't think multiple turns ahead
cause im bad
literally me
im a reactive player so i play immediately sometimes without thinking ahead
Chess negates my train of thought and leads me to make smol brain moves
ü§î if I asked nicely, there's a chance I could get Andrew Tang to cast
(a 1% chance, but still a chance)
tbt to when ryan tried to teach me chess

unless there were here when we changed it xD
hellloooo
henlo

hello tomik! and welcome
wht art piece is ur propic from btw 00:
oh yeah about badges
That was my favorite painting I had in my room for a decade. 200+ years old, random woman. But an insane piece of art!
I'm a sucker for antique artwork and statues haha
thanks for welcoming me everyone!
dope!! do you have a fave art mvt? 0:
welcome!
> I'm a sucker for antique artwork and statues haha
absolutely respect this, not many people are interested in the classical/older arts anymore D:
Dont really have any favorite artists. When a piece of art strikes me, it just does and I keep it for a very long time. But my discord profile pic was definitely my favorite piece
Thanks Irene! I've been surrounded by art and statues in my home for my whole life. Learned to love them
always glad to talk to a fellow art lover; if u ever wna share cool art or statues u find pls feel free to drop em in <#466007196396814346>  ! <:
thats super awesome!
<:banzai:442185100273123328>
classics can be super facsinating
Ooooh I've got so many! I'll find them off my dropbox this week and share some good ones
HHHHH can't wait !!
Some classics hold a flavor the modern world has lost

ashley could have been my student but she took a dif prof üò¶
math 20c is gross
math 20c is the only acceptable one out of the 20 series!!
I only hear stuff about 20c tbh
thank god i didn't take the final
a lot of people start with 20c
only cuz more ppl have to take 20c than 20d
good sutff üôÇ

math20c is the worst
havent taken 20d but seems fun
tfw my took 20d but she didn't need it
20c was a nightmare
like class was ez but holy shit those shapes r impossible to draw
i can give u 1 cheat sheet for 20d and ull be set for the qtr

Bc i could not do it
i failed all of the exams and didn't take the final last quarter

fear is ur mom watching disappointingly as u n ur brother try to figure out if u should microwave ham
we r 17 and 19
<:FeelsBadMan:441463646124507136>
Microwave ham? Like leftovers or regular packaged ham?
regular packaged ham
shih wen yall doin great sweetie
sliced
like ?? I think u dont need to???
but like ??? itll be warm n toasty if u do???
are u just making a sandwich
guess that's on u
hes putting it in a bagel
I usually dont warm it up
I told him no
i think its a preference
but I'm sure its valid
You can just warm it up on a pan
sometimes you want cold ham, sometimes you want warm ham ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
cold ham for ham sandwiches
warm ham for everything else
u see there is warm ham and there is cold ham
So how do ik if i should microwave ham
<:peepocry:640363747990306827>
Nonstick spray or butter in a pan. Toast the bagel with ham and cheese.
he has a bagel and a sunny side up
you can microwave ham
üò©
sounds bomb, rico
im p sure
<:PatrickGasm:600914637940326400>

oh no
WYM GYFU
it's SUMMER
summer is ass
LOL in la jolla its a breezy 68 degrees average
its so fuckin h o t
and all i do now is play video games and run around my neighborhood
sigh
maplestory gamer
shhhhh
where r my hungy streaks jas
ive been deprived
my friend told me she met u in maple LOL
non existant because i fucked up my lunch today and was dieing for 3 hours cause my stomach said no so i took like 4 stomach pills
<@!595010202613317632>  o ZOEY LOL
AHAHAHA yessir but ive been bored of maple
new event kinda oof
do ur dailies
:((
its so boring tho
imagine killing the same mobs for 17 days in a row because ur too lazy to grind to level up to 210 so u have like 800 mill saved and nothing to cube
ive been playing minecraft a solid 4-8 hours a day so like
wait LOL DEADASS ME TOO
LMAOO
the server im in made a bee farm AND I AM SO FUCKING HAPPY LOL
wbu what contraptions have u made
im a macbook gamer so 30fps minecraft is all i have
uhh me n my friend started a realm a few days ago
they made a zombie xp farm and we jus beat ender dragon yday
lots of villager eugenics for trading
im working on a blaze farm rn
i think theyre making an enderman farm
o oof LOL
wait deadass how do u make an enderman farm wtf
still early game kinda
cause our server needs pearls
idk theyre using the end mite attraction thing
OHHH
wow ok big brain why did i not think of that
sigh
<@!286708165612011531> they named the ender mite nInA so ur in our world now
<a:WhoPingMe2:618232464497704961>
big confuse what is a mite and why am i it
what's an enderman

bc hostile mobs despawn over time, u can name them to keep them around
so they needed a name for it
nice
why would u want them to be around if they're belligerent tho 0:
mucho confused
bc another mob in the game is attracted to it and will try to attack it
so bc they move towards the mite, u can make a farm around that
what in the
u named the mob after me? smh
blame THEM
the GAME or ur FRIEND
theyre the one tht made it
friend
OH OK makes sense i was like why does minecraft/maple story have names for mobs
i wouldnt name sth useful after u
or endermites
no theres a nametag item that u can use to name ur stuff
at least im nonoffensive we love being unproblematic
u say it like it's a bad thing to be problematic owo
gotta love bringing unneeded chaos wherever i go

hey guys im wondering when do u get an email from the academic integrity office, if anybody knows, please tell me. over 20% of the students have been accused of cheating in my class (including me)
theyre extra swamped this qtr so prob not til later
but idk
If its mass cheating the prof doesnt report but changes shit tho i think ?? or so those r the stories ive heard
there was mass cheating in my physics class where the prof said like half the class was cheating, but only a few reports i think
who up <:yeet:442868651792793601>
hi ari me ily wat is up
surprisingly i dont think any of my profs this qtr brought up any news of mass cheating
that or they alrdy knew and just took care of it on the downlow
hewwo
we got a coursewide email for my databases class lol
Im trying to apply for another major so im really upset
üò¶
bc of mass code copying
<@!224709487246704641> you got this fam
i didnt mass copy
i talked to myself during an exam
towards the end
while i was submitting
i go to different school ;0
omg i didnt even realize LOL
<:xd:612726759846051861>
<@!286708165612011531>  wait u pinged me i didnt see oof
maybe ask to meet w ur prof to discuss it?
i dont think we're able to??
Im pissed off bc im trying to transfer into ee and the results come out next month
im afraid i might not get in because i have a fucking BLANK on this class
whattt
do you guys have a student's advocates office??
and it's a requirement to transfer in
yeah but they're filled üò¶
contact student integrity office?
i mean did they say  you were suspected?
im trying üò¶
and if you didnt cheat, you have nothing to be afraid of
i know im not gonna get in trouble, its more like im afraid that i wont get into ece into next quarter
<@143214977585643520> all good hshdjwjdkqj
:0
can you contact the declaration office too?
cuz some classes require u to be an ece major to even enroll in them
maybe theyll make an exception? idk
I dont think we have a declaration office but yeah
im just really mad HAHA for being accused over talking to myself
I mean understandable from bot povs but ya a huge feelsbad
:((
enrollment office?
i think im able to easy my way in but i wanted to get in

Never hurts to email prof and see if u can have a meeting to talk it out

> would you guys say that the visual arts (studio) minor is the closest one if i wanted to dabble in the graphic design realm
<@!652073170890915864> Studio minor is more for hands on irl stuff like painting, sculpting, performance, etc. rather than graphic design
I dont think there is a minor/major thats only for graphic design but there are some courses within the VIS dept that are about graphic design or make you use photoshop and other graphic design apps
Goodmorning guys

ik this one girl who had replacement front teeth throughout the entirety of hs and i never knew
i only found out this yr in the yr ouf our lord 2020 when i had lunch with her and a group of friends
apparently she lost them in an accident or something but she had them for the entirety of hs
when i learned that i felt like my entire life was a lie
I see people are talking about teeth. My front tooth is fake and I was supposed to get an implant but they said I was too young and still may be growing, but good news is I haven't lost a significant amount of bone (I broke my jaw when I was seven and lost the permanent tooth back then and they thought by now my bone would have resorbed into itself)
*i have a retainer with a fake tooth on it
the bone would've reabsorbed-
i had a discussion abt teef with bippard a while back and how they're so fascinating but so fuckin WEIRD

> smthns missing
<@!262847360403636224> 
yeah money in my pockets
F
F
I FELT THAT
when i told my supervisor for si i wasnt coming bak for fall probably
i was like
*o shit i do not have an income*
RIP boba expenses
i mean working was moreso for savings so i graduate debt free
that sounds nice
i think i achieved that (?) hopefully
depends on how RA goes
bc everythings covered rly except housing for me
I thought RA covered housing expenses ? <:thonK:500668461501120525>
no i mean my fin aid
for college in general
ooo
I see
idk im fortunate bc all my income go directly to my savings
and also pretty gud fin aid
i also dont rly spend my savings so uwu
RA gives you full housing and like $800 a quarter in dining dollars? and triton cash
I don't remember
i have no idea wats going on w/ RA
but ive worked long enuf to cover at least 1-2 yrs of loans
RA is good benefits but the work can be shitty
if i get RA 3rd+4th yr then i should be good (?)
o
rly
well
im lowkey excited for RA work tho
its like
like plannign events n shit
it depends on the community
true
one of my friends couldn't stand it
and it wasn't the students
Yeah it depends on your suite
it was because the school just treats RA's like slaves
F
^
revelle ra'ing sucks
Oh what college ahh had a feeling tbh
its a lot of extra work on top of the fun events
o i got Sixth idk
sixth should be chiller
Sixth is SUPER chill
SUPER
From what I‚Äôve heard from my RAs
i thought the workload was relatively similar regardless of college
Especially cause I lived with both RAs first and 2nd year
thonk
its quiet and honestly most of us interacted once with our RA's and then never again lmao
nah
I saw mine everyday lol
each college kinda beats to its own drum
^
Yee
overall practice is the same but the difference in physical location
like whats available
oo
understandable
so the work load can be super different
sixth should be fun
New location too
Very Pog
if i get it :(
bc they r cutting people
F
we hope you do!!
I will speak it into existence
ü§î
You WILL get it
My revelle RAs had a lot of work but they made it work
im rly hoping so bc
new sixth was originally planned to be singles/doubles
so they dont have to cut as much ppl for social distancing
but it depends on space availability and number of students going back ig
Everywhere is singles and doubles now@though
I feel like not a lot of people are going back so I‚Äôm rooting for you Wendy
Bc of corona
no i mean like
they have to cut more RAs in other colleges that originally had triples
bc student to RA count
and they can hold less students
i rly hope everyone comes back at least winter qtr tho, although looking unlikely rn
but like
home big boring

Wb btw, we‚Äôve missed youüò¢
yeet, ive been busy with work and life
so ive been using my free time to game
Party pack lit
And yuh understandable
especially with terraria 1.4 out
ooo <:pepepoog:606017447623131166>
o shit it darren
<a:PepePopcorn:554328145344462848>
Oh look my home town is in the news because people got stabbed
<:yeet:442868651792793601>
Nothing changes
where is ur home town
i want to be stabbed too
Reading, England
<a:ohohoho:636686946734964786>
o thats too far
Probably not by an islamic radical i'd imagine
not worth stabby stab
i-
I dunno if they stabbed people at the protest or just in general
<:blobshrug:360216835083337731>
<:yeet:442868651792793601>
Mostly due to 'double standards' of Palestine
The whole migrant issue is a very complex one where I'm from
Where I'm from
even during a protest
<:blobshrug:360216835083337731>
i thought u meant just 1-2 getting stabbed from like a robbery or some shit
<:yeet:442868651792793601>
I know there is a lot of anti BLM sentiment among the more radical islamic population
<:yeet:442868651792793601>
3 dead
not mass stabbing for political reasons
stabbing is... not legal...
<:yeet:442868651792793601>
a few more injured
I mean you go racist white folks in the north that don't help with the whole 'integration' thing that my country is big on
In the south its more of a divide between British people of colour and migrants
<a:ahmmmm:463751863171416082>
Who very very very much dislike each other
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
I hope it doesn't get judged as terror related though
If it does then that will provide an easy victory path for Boris in the next election
and also football manager 2020 since i dont care about football anyways

Why are full stops so weird and unpredictable
<a:pepehell:717609376420200458>
it was bc i wasn't eating meat for a whole month, my diet probs affected tht
and i do have an app tht tracks it and i get it like,,,, every 6 weeks?
I know diet could affect, but not eating meat does that too?
Just a turkey baster full of bbq sauce
yeah idk why either, but tht was the most radical change i had regarding my diet and lifestyle habits
i was also eating less but hhmmmmmm idk
anyway
time to take a tylenol

>>> Organic Method:

¬†¬†¬† Roll six times recording in order using the best 3 of 4d6.¬† Re-roll any one ability score taking the best of the two.¬† Then switch any two scores.
I like this method
(if you don't have anything in particular you want to play)
(^ me)
"in order" forces more flavor than typical, but the extra reroll makes up for that
If you still end up with a negative net modifier, or something really below average after the free reroll, repeat the process

Hello, hihi, if you have time and are willing to help, it'd be really nice to go to this link and like me and <@!151123898698563584> 's hackathon project! It's an app that lets you round up your change and donate it to BLM: https://devpost.com/software/makes-cents

it'd help alot :3
Round up change? People can't round up to the nearest dollar?
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
it's like the roundup app where each of your transactions is rounded up to the nearest dollar, and the amount that it's rounded up by is donated

Yeah I can barely do 6 hours
1.6 bhops
ok but its like hanging out w ur friend for 6 hrs
bc mc is pretty grindy at some point
Mainly because I don‚Äôt have much people to play with but also not much of a gamer anymore
like for xp, mining etc
But that also might be because I don‚Äôt have a consistent friend group
To play with

and i was like FUCK
I JUST WANT A JOB
FUCK
wait
Facts
oki im done
our major was impacted
too
D:
a lot of people
lost their internships
D:
Rip <:pepehands:464568955533524992>
covid needs to yeet off now
actually it's too late for that
yeah true but making a cs internship remote is 200000% easier than most other internships
they wont just suddenly give internships back
yea agreed that cs was impacted, but objectively it's one of th eleast impacted fields overall
<:sweat:713285695694831647>
F
both my parents are still able to work full time so its a blessing
If covid could just kindly fuck off thatd be cool
agree
^
Die miss.rona
i hate
how my laptop camera is at the bottom of my screen
some people just said fuck covid and pretend it doesnt exist
Fr
everything is fine
fuck THOSE people
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
maybe if we fall in love with it itll go away too

> maybe if we fall in love with it itll go away too
<@!303002872646467596> oop
It won‚Äôt love me back
That‚Äôs ok for those people we employ the method of **natural selection**
boomer remover
oc said no masks and then the gov was like haha sike
*just mutate into a non lethal one*
oc is
whack
Karen‚Äôs stay mad
Oc is mucho interesante
*like the influenza that was a century ago*
people in america compared to people in other countries really be barely giving a fuck about covid smfh
whack bc all of the karens went out to protests the masks and everyone else was at home
<:xd:612726759846051861>
so no one else was their to uphold the other side
everything sucks
there*
Remember,
We‚Äôre in election season
The masks only work if everyone wears them they aren‚Äôt to protect the wearer but rather to protect everyone else
yea its stupid cuz trump is focusing more on his campaign than actually trying to do anything
Big sad
This is why other countries are thriving
america has a bad stigma of "you only wear masks if you're sick"
but its also self prevention
Aight guys time to move to Europe
my mom told me a story about her friend who works at a preschool
i dont got mulahhhh
^
bc covid got rid of my internshipppp
ahhhhhhhhh
<:peepocry:640363747990306827>
F
D:
I‚Äôm poor in general
in like march or something when it was kinda hitting america, her friend wore a mask to work and the other teachers were like are you sick?? if not take it off bc you'll scare the children
I-
THEY SHOULD BE SCARED

It‚Äôs good

I like hot fuzz
It‚Äôs funny
yess. i like the directors other works too
oh what else did the director film?
shaun of the dead, the world's end, baby driver
oooh
i havent watched scott pilgrim but i heard its good
wait scott pilgrim is hella good
he was supposed to direct ant man but he left the project
or at least i remember it being that lol
also whats rgu and b99?
bu some of his style is still in it
rgu = revolutionary girl utena
b99 = brooklyn 99
okie okie
wait are you an incoming transfer or already transfered in?
incoming
icic, what made you decide on UCSD?
Yay <:kirblush:613942747224604702>
i heard the CS program is p good
and SD seems p chill
<:banzai:442185100273123328>
idk where all the other cs majors r at they were just active a sec ago
yo b99 is such a good show
Probably doing their internship
hi
no
Oh it‚Äôs henry
O
ohp there they r
hi wife
@ comp sci where yall at?
Hi wife <:banzai:442185100273123328>
just ping cs helper ez
<:bulbaowo:615441070033207307>
didn't feel like pining lol
yo wassup
It‚Äôs l uke
yesyes
imagine being CS
yikes
cog sci is the real cs
we are just lowly clowns
thank you shih wen
CS?
You mean clinical studies
you mean chinese studies
Anyone down for some classical studies?
i prefer celtic studies
christian studies*
im so sleepy <:FeelsBadMan:441463646124507136> i genuinely believe a 9-5am is more plausible than a 9-5pm for me at this point in my life <:pepehands:464568955533524992>
Hello it is I, Catholic studies major
yall r studing?
screw that
Idk I just go to church once a weeküòÇ
Do I get my degree now?
ofc
All they give me is bread
thats more than the number of times i go to class per week
Tfw you spent more time praying for your grades than actually studying or going to classes <:kek:490008924414803968> <:kek:490008924414803968> <:kek:490008924414803968>
maybe that's why i'm doing bad
my mom tells me to pray so i can do good <:kek:490008924414803968>
but i don't
Its honestly not abt how much u study but abt how u study
like i could spent 3 hrs watching chin‚Äôs lectures on flip flops
or i can watch a 15 min video off yt
And learn the same amount, if not more
but you miss chin's dad jokes
they r on his slides <:wotthink:441465363671154698>
but it aint the same...
and also in the beginning of lecture so u could just watch that
jk i dont listen to lectures
And thats like an extra 2 mins
If ive learned anything from college its that *just because u pay to get a college education doesnt always mean that its where u should turn to to get educated*
<:FeelsBadMan:441463646124507136>
in conclusion, *scam*

bold of richard to assume he's the only one on my waitlist-turned-fanlist
i hope "he's" was "he was" past tense bc not anymore
i didn't know tht when u blocked someone on discord u can still see their msgs in servers
a scam
u can't ...
it just showed "1 blocked msg" which is the most annoying thing ever ... bc sometimes i click it and it shows ur msgs
thinking out loud wht if i snapped u and then muted shadow realm to not see anything at all

"pssst i think this guy may be the avatar"
I want to write and finish the nomad songs they sung
an honorable feat
The love song that they sang is my fav but there's only two lines
why it's a long long way to ba sing se
but the girls in the Citay oh they look so pretttaayyyy!
they kiss so sweet that you really have to meet
the girls from ba sing seeeeeee
<a:catdance:593492913305157632>
idk what's getting into me but im ending the night legitimately thinking of opening an onlyfans and getting a navel piercing
ah i see it's that time of the year
i too think about that sometimes
indeed it is
v legitimate options
quarantine has really gotten to you
but like secure the bag however you can am i right?
imo it's a part of life where you feel insecure about the future and the uncertainty of everything gets kinda scary
so we look to short-term decisions that can relieve the anxiety
quarantine kinda just amplifies the omnicity
Im not advocating, cause to each their own. Though the girls that do try to make an onlyfans, have a higher chance of securing the bag than guys trying to become a twitch streamer
plus, never have to show you face lol
What is securing the bag?
becoming financially stable
the bag being money
I thought you were talking about colostomy bags.
:^0
im flattered that you think i know what colostomy is
p o o p  b a g
like you know when you rob a bank? gotta secure the bag of money lol
I thought it was talking about luxury bags like LV
I do hear the onlyfans kinda like an MLM scheme though
when quarantine makes you feel down :(
drugs make you feel up üôÇ
yup
i mean what no don't do drugs
Yeah! Like going outside and doing exercise to get that sweet, sweet natural serotonin!
but we cant go outside rn üò¶
üôÇ
üôÅ
eat kiwi's apparently they give seratonin
are there seratonin chewables
like seratonin gummies
i'd take those
But then you'll trick your brain even further to not naturally release serotonin
Checkmate
not really chewables but huggables
give people a hug for seratonin and dopamine
i have late nite munchies but i already brushed my teeth
am sad
just brush them again
but
im so lazy
not too much dopamine tho
or else you'll have neuropsychiatric problems <:xd:612726759846051861>
this is why hugging is addicting
dopamine is part of the reward system after all
and subsequently addiction
thats why its so hard to quit sugar
i had a choco cake for birthday
and i still want sweets
i ate ice cream today i should stop
brain chemical go brrr
that moment when too much dopamine means schizophrenia but too little means parkinson's
<:headscratch:593920753024630785>
> quarantine has really gotten to you
<@!213151486434082817> u don't say
> but like secure the bag however you can am i right?
<@!213151486434082817> i think i'm more enamored by the thought of having an audience ngl
Dopamine bad
But dopamine good
5-HT good
But 5-HT bad
We love the bwain
i mena audience is an audience lol
i check this chat and i see this, very proud of this server
i had brownies
my munchies have been satisfied
my hair is almost long enough for a manbun and idk if thats the move
like this is a one in a lifetime opportunity for a manbun
or a mullet
i mean its not like ur going out anytime soon
go for it

BRO
his supreme days
:)
i thouhgt someone stole my bogo
the pool rlly ties it tgt
but
it was just
underneath spencers bed
with his fucking strawberries
it was there for like a solid 3 weeks
> his supreme days
<@345083648124649485> all my orifices just. clenched in the worst way possible
maybe longer
why
were there
straw
BECAUSE SPENCER
ok andrew
is it spencer story time
...
spencer had....isues
yeah ....
see this is why i sHOULD love women more
but my brain
i mean im here to always support spencer
but i also love
telling
spencer stories
esp the ||meth / grindr / hooker trap house|| one
is somehow attracted to me-ü§¢ü§¢ to mü§¢ü§¢ü§¢ü§Æü§Æ i can't even say it
well dont give the best parts away too early
do we talk ab how rish kinda did meth
wait _wat_
even i didnt know about htat
rish took a hit yea
im pretty sure
but it didnt rlly light
or sth?
ooooo the trap house spunds fun
cotton mouth meth fueled slurping noises <@!345083648124649485> w
how r ur war flashbacks rn
passed out on the couch for 3 days straight type beat

many war stories to be told
prob nina rn
i think the one that stuck with me the most thou
sorry nina. we all have sordid pasts. for me, i was a supreme boy.
was when u thought watermelonisha killed him
forgive me pls
BROOO
HE WAS
IN THE OCEAN
I THOUGHT HE GOT MURDERED
the next day he was like
ok but like
o i was playing pogo
thats not the first thing u think of
o i rmbr tht from ur finsta
watermelonisha was pretty sick tho
wat was her real name again
gabby?
like starting a new life, becoming a cosmetologist, and pulling up in a mercedes to introduce urself as watermelonisha
kinda a flex
i think gabby yea
i can actually confirm shes real
i think i liked her the best
cat was just....
we dont talk about cat
which one was cat
i dont like the one w loud noises
> sorry nina. we all have sordid pasts. for me, i was a supreme boy.
<@595010202613317632> it's ok, i built my personality off of being called gay slurs in middle school and being abused, we all have our low points
the one that got spencer to send money to her
oh that one was fucked up
like she rlly took advantage of a guy w crazy mental problems to work until 3am
to fund her whatever
lowkey besides those 2 the tohers just blend
also there was the lis one ?
the one that actually came over frequently
the one in the village
oh right her
but i followde her on ig
and she made a post ab her bf that was deployed ???
so ig she was cheating on her actual bf w spencer?
idk?
> prob nina rn
<@303002872646467596> o the suicidal thoughts have been quiet for a while, rn im just confused but hey, fun stories
spencer cant be explained
fun after the fact
living through them is a different story
bro theres being woken up to ur roommate that was gone all night, who comes back at 10am holding a bag of meth and saying that he was on meth all night
and hes climbing up ur ladder
i have never been so scared
spencer on meth is kinda scary but he was also not that bad ? like as far as methheads go he didnt hurt anyone
o h
nina I just meant as joke
I sorries
didnt mean to offend or joke on serious topic
but also as I must be up by 9 tmr I shall say gn everyone <:PepeHeart:567839212557172737>

the last time was when i came back after winter quarter and he wanted to bundle up in my comforter while i worked
richard i'll wack U
ill wack U

henlo frens i have just finished watching atla
and u realize that final agni kai was a better fite than aang vs ozai
hmmmmm
dont @ me
i think the message/graphics is better
but honestly azula's outcome doesnt do it for me
just straight up painted as a monster from start to finish
she def wasn't fleshed out v well
i like the descent to madness thou
i did like the beach scene tho
that was nice
it was a sad fight, u could hear and see tht
descent to madness def had it's flare
whts canon is zuko had her locked up in a str8jacket and never got her mental health treatment
fuuuccckkkk
also suki died young so sokka never married
also aang was a bad father
_wait_
etcetcetc
so anyways whats ur guys favorite avatar
kyoshi ofc
ok well to be fair being the avatar coudlnt have been good for the fam
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/601227479423647760/690057984906100781/94952391-5118-4382-BCEA-5BF78EEAA401.JPG
this is mine
all i can say is maybe roku
ive never watched but it sounds rlly interesting tho i rlly wanna watch
<:dinopalm:713291565501775872>
^ this is mine
avatar yang chen was coool
<@595010202613317632> ur the worst
also can we take a moment and appreciate that aang gave up basically god hood to get laid
What.
STOODPPOOFO EIGHT THETE
<:kek:490008924414803968>
man.
what does that mean
also adult sokka can rail me
hol up-
bc he was a monk
choosing katara over opening the final chakra point
and they have to forsake bodily desires or whateva
ma boi guru pathik was never seen again after üôÇ
oh thats what you meant
also aang died young because his constant avatar state in the iceberg took a toll on his life
F

like look at sokka and tell me tht u don't wna be railed by him
zuko tho
oho he do be looking good too
They all look rly good
i wanted more of adult toph
how old is momo god damn
and she never got her life changing field trip with zuko
Momo is immortal
hes prob blind and senile at that point
they're like what
mid 20s?
momo came into the team when aang was 12
and he was already that size
so i mean
ok but momo with a _gun_
what
one fear
WAIT I HAVE A PIC OF THT

tell me this isnt tru

hard af
also i like how all the atla fans came out of hiding
<:kirbygun:613942917135990803>
physucks

my own daughter has forsaken me <:pepehands:464568955533524992>

That‚Äôd a relief
They had to cut him out of the car though
He was a dog walker, so he had 3 dogs in the back of his truck
I think they‚Äôre ok because it looks like animal control just showed up
Oof that‚Äôs spoopy, god everything looks okay
thats some scary shit
reeee why is brainstorming so hard
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
<:peepocry:640363747990306827>
make it easier by just going on break <:think:613867581522313231>
HAHA honestly
we havent taken one
we're on our break now
zz it be rough tho
F
i dun like our ideas all that much but i cant think of shit x)
F
F
I like the idea i thought of but its probably lowkey not accomplishable bc im kind of dumb but its also the one that interests me most bc its the most relevant to me
so F
<:kek:490008924414803968>
naptime tracker/
?
:^)
no its related to skincare
<:kirblush:613942747224604702>
it is relevant to me bc i have skin
jk its bc my skin big broken
ye i get what you mean, Shih Wen
idk, everyone has diff interests
idk if its the best for resume tho
but im down for watever we end up with ig
so like
as long as its not like
resume wise
they really only care
that you learned something
and its something you're passionate about
ya LMAOO basically
so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
like one of them is very focused
yea def more about your skills
on doing system stuff
but something more related to wat i wana do in future
but its like whatever interests you
yeah like technically
i sshould be a dev
xd
but i think i'd rather be a pm in the future, so thats why i took this position instead
:0
stan
dev
is
hard
i am smol brain
this guys like deadset on the one thatll look the best on resume and im like <:peepocry:640363747990306827> u see but im dumb so idk sounds kinda hard
LMAOOOO
yeah
these guys
are
kinda big brained
im scared
D:
but i didnt wana say anything bc i was like we will prob break it down to manageable work
yuh
It just seems hard starting out bc we havent broken it down
xddd
are all of you working together?
idk some of the apps don't seem as bad but one of them was like ah we gotta do the sdsc stuff
jenny alex and i are on same team
üôÇ
oo that app dev work
i think its bc he wanted the connections bc he thought we‚Äôd work alongside them
yeah
no
xd
wait
huh?
i know thats what he was thinking
but it sounds more like they just kinda tell us wat to do and we kinda do it
yes but actually no
yeah
not like side by side with us every step
i know some of the engineers
they're busy
prob not gonna work alongside them
so i was like kinda confused for a second
yeah
its more of like
they'd be like
yeah this is some background on the company or something
and this is what i would do
and then thats it
omg when the guy started talking abt making revenue off our work i was like wait were we suppos to thinkt hat far
meanwhile all our ideas lowkey sound dummy easy
<:REEE:413531193242288138>
Bc idk if u noticed but i only had a very general idea of my idea
bc i thought we were looking into specifics later
mans came in with a purpose LOL
we're kinda doing specifics too
n he pulled up the doc with like revenue and competitors
so like
and i was like oh fuck oh fuck i didnt think that far
one of them actually applied
as product owner
or preferred
and you ccan tell who xd
ahh icic
Ya
LOOL
it scared me bc he went before me and i was like
issok, i respect his hustle
o man im gna look so dumb
<:FeelsBadMan:441463646124507136>
nah its a team thing, no comparing
more like *he went four steps ahead*
big scawey
i get where hes comin from thi
he just knows what he wants to do
these people be like, "like my cse 150 something class"
and im like ah yes so cse 12
ye esp since he applied for product owner like i can see his thought process
LMAO jenny
i msged alex and was like were we supposed to think of revenue i didnt think of revenue did u think of revenue
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è precisely why i chose not to be dev
lol
and he was like <:yeet:442868651792793601>
homeboy wants bank
<:think:613867581522313231>
respectable tho
just scared me for a hot minute LMAOO
this group is too big brain
^
man keeps bringing upper divs
i thought we were just pitching ideas and working out specifics tn
he shot down our roommate thing LOL
I didnt think they were coming in with specifics
<:kek:490008924414803968>
man straight up was like it takes a week
*its not much but its honest work*
cse110 is like a group of 10
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
so he cant rly compare this to cse100 bc its half the size
1110
$/&:!.
so it takes 2 weeks then
FUCK

If I had AptX HD fully agreed

Though the Sony's are better
But cost more when not on sale
surface headphones 2 tho ü•µ
if yall want a discount on them hmu üëÄ
Surface Headphones 2 are actually not bad
Though the best value (ignoring more specialist real brands) is seemingly the new Razer one that appears to be made by Sony
if yall plan on buying any msft hardware actually <:xd:612726759846051861>
And even has Sony logos
I‚Äôve got an old-ass pair of senheiser headphones from like the 80s and they‚Äôre nice

for me
Who did you take it with?
ben-ezra

<:Pepe_MonkaChrist:612363181318209562>
my friend and chad's friend
both rec'd him
so maybe we're being trolled
oof
i heard they're all hard tho
its jus a hard class
andrew astro revelle said it was easy so i must believe him
ya but u dont understand andrew astro revelle brain
as his suitemate i want to say that everything i actually knew how to do in 20a
was what he taught me in 5 mins on argo's whiteboard
ok i said the first 3 weeks were easy
udk about the other 7
what does 20a even end on
did you just say
astro
i dont know
i almost slept through the final
but thats not andrew astro revelle that andrew physics revelle
and idk what happened after mt2
cant be trusted
yeah andrew astro revelle said that a  few weeks ago, idk who this new guy is
o
o
imagine what my 20a grade wouldve been like if i didnt show up late to the final wihtout a cheatsheet
late to a final
20A
yea by like 3 mins
woah
not like
actually late
i jus
sprinted to peterson
3 mins is rookie numbers
I may or may not have gone to a midterm 40 mins late
i-
how'd that go
bruh there was a reddit post
ab how someone
did the 20e final
got an A in the class
this quarter
we fat chillin
hours late
flex tomer
what class was it

mae 365a *
My friend went to bild 3 midterm and hour late, still got one of the higher scores in the class <:kek:490008924414803968>
no nick the entire mae 365 seq
what'd ya get on the 20d final <@!87652481768620032>
98
i don't understand how the median can be 97
but an average of 80
some ppl rlly bombed the final
someone got a 14 üòî
apparently
wat THE FUCK is mae 365
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
c'mon if u have 24 hours for the final u could at least do better than a 14 üòî
idk u tell me prof tomer

postgrad level mae obviously
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248> <:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248> <:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
yeah some of those 20d questions were very difficult to get wrong
I had 18 with Kitsela and it was really good
i like how the ones that told me to clearly explain what i was doing
i ignored
and didnt explain
still gave me full credit
flex nick
yknow that one problem with the generalized eigenvectors
but you couldn't use the formula
> kitsela is literally the best prof at ucsd change my mind
<@!595010202613317632> kitsela‚Äôs 18 was apparently REALLY bad this spring
i literally copied from the homework explanation and it didn't work but i got full credit
bro
i think the Ta's were over it
2 graders for all dem finals
bro the ta's for my class
hate me
20e
just ... gimme the regrade request. ..
i've already yeeted 20d information out of my mind
that was my plan with 20e
but jokes on me i gotta map spherical coordinates onto a frustrum for my research lab
with e q u a l s u r f a c e a r e a
the whole last 4 wweeks of 20e
ok whats the research lab
was a blur
like
process
do u just ask profs
and theyre like
ok bet
and ur in?
yea pretty much
they hook you up with a phd student and you're off
wtf
thats sick
i thought it was a legnthy daunting process
nah if they need people they'll onboard you real quick
ok bet
i went from hey gimme a job to writing stuff for them in less than a day
oh raini
have u done ece 45
no i've been saving all my ece classes
do u get paid
?
btw
like idrc if i get paid bc i jus want experience
yea but not from the lab
how'd u type the 'btw' so quick after the ?
there's a summer research program for the ece departmenet
just type faster
ah i c ty for info
mhm
nick you're just slow
no lara
that was p fast
what
gj nick
woah that's quick
i-
wait raini
which phys r u on
i'm taking 2d fall
.
did u do 2c this quarter ?
yea
with shotweel
how tf did u do 20d 20e and 2c
*shotwell
20e was
i did 20d 20e 2c and 199
in one quarter
20d and 20e were classes where u forgot until the due dates
:>
damm
the trick is to not do any work for any of the classes
i did 20e and 2a last qtr + 3 major classes
until you absolutely have to
and thought it was on the upper end of doable
tru raini
why did u do 2a
ricado
i couldve done
1a
but
i didnt know
y are u doing physics
revelle
haha lol
why
not
chem
?
we need chem phys bild
+ 2 more sciences
yikes
yikes
so for the 2 more u can choose like another bild, chem 6b, phys 2b
etc
i did cogs 17
and sio LOL
sio is ez
tragic choosing of colleges
yea i first choice'd revelle cuz it sounded cool i think
at least u didnt get marshall
i-
NICK
how did so many ppl rank based on how cool they sounded üòî
that's how i picked sixth
ur expecting research from someone that submitted bullet points for their uc essay
bruh
my dad told me to rank marshall first LMAO
how r u gonna rank based on coolness
then pick sixth
culture art and technology sounded so much cooler than all the other ones
tbh i didnt think i was gonna go to ucsd
i just shotgunned uc apps
oh i didnt even know wwarren's motto until orientation
well
only 4 of them
but still
i didnt get into any other schools other than ucsd
i chose based on reddit
not even my safety schools
f
college apps and decisions <a:pepehell:717609408057573466>
i didnt have a decision
it was ucsd or not college
the only uc's i applied to are the ones in socal
oh i applied to a bunch of out of states LOL
i mean i got into university of buffalo
and early action stuffz
but thts like
choosing between csu bakersfield
and ucsd
so
ez
bakersfield has a csu?
i only applied to schools in cali
yea
yes
I had UCLA, UCSD, and SDSU, but UCSD I could commute so there's that.
csu bakersfield

i can ask him and to boost this server
<@!345083648124649485> da tru boi
i know <@!87652481768620032> had something like that

and 50mb is like
a lot
tbh
ok but the _flex_ value
flex on the other ucsd discords

sigh
im not surprised my giftone didnt go through kek
n lowkey i was getting kinda annoyed
i wouldnt be surprised if it was him that sent in multiple forms
just switch to a CS major irene
bc he said like 6 times
üòå
wat he wanted us not to do
i dont know why hes even in this internship
do an engineering mechanics minor
hes a senior
i was too so i just took over
lol
i was gonna let y'all
do stuff
n i was like ok chill let them decide
and i was like
aight
no fuck it
y'all get no power for now
LMAOO
why is a senior who seems to know so much doing this internship LOL
in a good way
üôÇ
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
wait what's wrong with a chat bot lol (unless it's basic af)
<@!87652481768620032> absolutely not. cse 20 was a warning shot
and i ran
its basic af
thats why
what group is it for
o
:^)
nvm then
wait alex
you're not in that group
lol
kek ik
spouting what ive been told
no idea, henry
oh right
caitlin
chatbot is too easy to do for a 10 week internship imo
tru
cogs 18 intensifies
*i wana do my skincare one bc the others i chose didnt make it to the final :^(*
still dont understand why our dude is doing this internship when it seems like he knows enough to do others
experience
i thought it was gonna be like an ML-trained chatbot lol, but yeah chatbot's prob too ez
caitlin said it was a basic chatbot
no ML
code a person
code a person to replace nick
hes annoying asf
no u
he also didnt get me boba
where was my delivery huh...........
<@!134874605121699840>
i only wanted to do the app
you've had 7 leaves right
> wait what's wrong with a chat bot lol (unless it's basic af)
<@!334441828512432129> it was like a chat bot for hdh website
LMAO
i cant imagine how much there is to do with that
the ones he voted so hard against
i know who shot down the apps tho REEEE
KEK
also thats
way too simple
angor
if we're gonna be putting this much time
<@!87652481768620032> helo
into a product
7 leaves?
bruh he went on a speech against apps right before
wdym the chatbot will be more useful than hdh
**no apps**
and i was like
<:kek:490008924414803968>
whats going on
im so angor
*chill*
i want apps
<:huh:442185049870434307>
ucb
theres just a guy
in our group
who is a senior
i want the skincare one who hopefully
WHO MOVED
what
ok
why does this exist
ucb
that wants stuff on his resume
oops
hehe
<:xd:612726759846051861>
KEK
this is great
i like dis
the man is desperate for stuff on resume and proceeded to not put any good ideas of his own LOL
<@!87652481768620032> <:WhyPingMe:618664927133040651>
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
theres one guy who is very adamant about what he does (not) want to do and hes made like 4 speeches today on why we shouldnt do apps because he didnt wana do apps
nothing that made it to the end was a thing he suggested
<@!303002872646467596> said the sky <:PatrickGasm:600914637940326400>
the man couldnt even suggest anything good
angor
damn alex pop off
he was just there shooting ideas down
whats apps
make an edm visualizer
can i have context
<:kek:490008924414803968>
im like fine w/ him im jus kinda annoyed bc he seems very adamant about wat he wants and im like ? this is a group thing and hes just shooting other peoples ideas down and pushing for whatever he wants
can i shoot down anyone whos shooting you down
pls
i have big pp
the man didnt even push for anything he wanted
HE SUGGESTED NOTHING REEE
bro at one point he was like *i did that in a week its too easy*
he just wants
and i was like
*oop*
not a single thing that made it to the end was his idea
angor
alex r u good
tbf
F
the only things thta made it to the end was like
he wants to do what ryan recommended ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
yeth said the skyyy
can i shoot his ideas down
^
niv
my skincare thing and the given prompts
inv
LMAOO
<:xd:612726759846051861>
yeah ik
reee
he wants to do the given prompts bc he thinks he'll get to work closely with the staff
networking ig
did he say that kek
but ryan said they werent even working with us side by side
makes sense but also bro
yeah
they're
a lot of people are here to just work in a team
ryan is too busy for us
kek
xd
if u wanted to work with developers that closely, should just hit em up
ryan said himself that theyd be too busy to work side by side w/ us
y'alls 10 week internship is really quite dramatic
^
well
not really
if he wanted to work with developers he shouldve done his research
just working in teams can be hard
it's been 2 days lol
its only day 2 too
<:angerey:613942969367789588>
^ what jenny said
clash of opinions
its not that bad
^
its really chill actually
Clash of clans
what company is this for
just a couple of people who are more stubborn ig
i mean its chill i was jus getting irritated bc he kept shooting everyones ideas down and being adamant on his own personal interests despite it being a group effort
^
he was kinda just annoying everyone
im just annoyed because he didnt put anything forth himself
thats all im irritated at
he put down like 2 ideas
which ones
i could sense it so i didnt wanna work on the next things yet
LOL
they were ok but he also didnt advocate for them he just shot down everything else
wasnt the news one his
yeah
and the automobile one
**fact check**
i think?
idk
nah
idk
auto was other guy
i rmb 1-2 from him
condom guy
xd
<:kek:490008924414803968>
automobile is online
i mean
i respect his hustle
condom guy is chill asf
love the dude LMAOOO
same
i liked our guys energy
that man
put so many ideas
wwhats the saga of vape guy looking like
and was so accepting
of different ideas
^
thats jeef and mary's team, nick
Whats condom guy
ship condoms to u
:^)
he just had an idea for a condom thing
11/10 really appreciated how he was very accepting and open minded
üôÇ
how do u mix CS and condoms
the vape guy?
cs majors r sad n lonely
~~he wants to be product owner so we'll prob vote, just vote for him <:kek:490008924414803968> ~~
LOL
üëÄ
its whoever
the condom guy?
has the better idea of the product
or the one that shot everything else
condom
ahh
wait how many people are doing this internship
the one who shot down everything was it literally only the fake news he put forth
condom guy is chill i think he'd make a good product owner
i check this chat for the first time in a while
samer
same*
and all i see is condom and condom man
condom guy would be a good product owner
he would be your leader, then i would just work closely with him to help organize
thanks for not disappointing yall <3
seems like he owuld put a lot of effort to make sure things work
hes very open minded and listens
yea
i think they said its like 40 smth total <@!134874605121699840>
no like 30
i definitely dont want the other guy to be an owner
i still cannot discern what it is
because i bet hell be super controlling
its a development internship, raini
and want things his exact way
what does that even mean
development internship
meaning you make stuff as a developer
if the other guy is owner ill cry bc he seems like he'd be mean n controlling
learn to create stuff from ground up
angy
<:PEPESCREAM:466446495747670027>
the man deadass just went *fuck u all and ur ideas* right before we voted
I've been pinged twice
Who did it
lmao
and i went <:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
Oh
scawey
Andrew
**no apps**, ok lets vote xd
Unimportant
the vape guy is actually p chill, he's been contributing to our ideas a lot, he just throws slightly uncomfortable comments every now and then
it was like a good 2 min speech
on not doing apps
when im just trying to make user stories
but im illiterate
<:pepehands:464568955533524992>
uncomfortable comments? <@!151123898698563584>
like what
"that's what she said"
oh noes
not the sixth grader
when im tryna make user stories but im not 100% sure wat #1 is asking and at this point im too scared to ask the slack bc ryan is in it
and he already explained it
LMAOOO
dw he doesnt mind
and we can ask tomorrow
ill make user stories for the skincare one and the visualizer one for now
~~ive asked him to repeat stuff bc i wasnt listening a couple of times <:kek:490008924414803968> ~~
i have a decent vision for the skincare one
tbh
the skin care one
is big brain
like feature wise and stuff

~~team bonding~~

i just hit whatever i saw first
:^)
can u hit me
omw
alex ok honest opinion
do u think the skincare one will end up winning..................
bc i highkey
wana do it
LMAOOO
the other two r ok but not as interesting to me bc its not relevant to me
i know yo uwant skincare
the other 2 are bc its more industry stuff
your skin is shit
yeah
i also kinda wanted to do the github one but it didnt win
:(
ya
i dont mind doing the ksincare one
its interesting
like when i did dev stuff for them, it was kinda similar to that
üôÉ
the other two are cool but i dont know
made me hate being a dev so now im a PM tho ‚ù§Ô∏è
<:kek:490008924414803968>
what any of the terms mean
:^)
its
big terms
theyre like ok
its a lot simpler, they just use big words
they arent bad/boring but they arent interesting
if that makes sense
welcome to the life of a cs major
many things u will do wont be interesting :^)
KEK understandable
but i figured if i was gna do a proj might as well make an interesting one so i can be all passionate abt it n shit for interviews
xdd
idk i kinda want to do ai or machine learning
*why did u make the skincare app*
i think skincare is computer vision he said
i wanted to not have shit skin
:^)
idk abt the other two
i think the visualizer isnt machien learning
its not
idk abt the first one bc i actually dont knwo wat it is
none of them are machine learning
i would rather do the first one than the last one
ya computer vision is as close as ur gna get bc the other two dont seem as backend
LMAO
im kinda sad the
github one didnt go through
bc skincare and github were my top 2 choices
i didnt go github one at all
mainly cause
im 99% sure its out there somewhere and
like
idk
didnt sound interesting
understandable
the other ones had big words
which means big brain
big words *scawey*
KEK
which means big words on resume
:^)
u right
watch during resume theyre like
wat does this mean
*u tell me*
LMAOOO
nah but
im cool w/ watever we end up with
id prefer the skincare one but the other 2 dont seem too bad
well actually the other 1
i dont rly like the visualizer one
LMAOO
i didnt mind anything as long as it wasnt games

<:kek:490008924414803968>
i was kinda surprised too, shih wen
xd
no offense
lol
but they sound
like they have a better idea of what to use
idk the moment computer vision was put into play
i stared at it for like 20 mins and was like ?? staff?? who else would look at this?? lmaoo
so it was interesting
wdym
its just users and developers for the user stories
wait bruh
wait im actually stupid
LMAOOO
wait what
does that mean
the moment they said data training and computer vision
I was like uh oh
isnt it just we write
and yeah i heard computer vision and got scared
what the user will do with it
yeah p much
and then what we want as developers
yea
like
uh
but who r the users
skin care app
i want it to
?

The condom idea was honestly not bad the only problem i saw with it was the concern i brought up
sabotage
:o
also
holy fuck i have such a terrible headache and idk why üôÉ
time to go eat üôÇ
its bc of the computer
jk LMAOO
> tell me if my skin is unhealthy or not
<@446932571192819713> describe
OH this wasn't an actual q carry on
üòÇ
Just an app idea

oh also the guy that me and caitlin were fighting
turned out to be not too bad
he was being super like questioning about the ideas WE put forth
he was acting like he was scared to do something harder than what he proposed
when the shit he proposed was super simple
and u could prob finish it in about 2 sprints
is anyone out in SD rn selling stuff
pref gummies
LMAO i think a lot of people are home rn :3
o thats gud
ya idk i rmb eating lunch and i get a msg from caitlin telling me shes gna kill someone bc its day2 and shes found a snake in the group
And i was like <:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
LOOL he was a bit rude at first
he was like (about the existing project ideas which were mostly his and were mostly p simple) "oh i think we can just start with these and then expand on it if we have time" or something like that
but the way he said it seemed like
steph do you know anyone
he was saying to do one of his ideas
no i dontt sorry
how are you doing? been a hot min
oh shit what are you ranting abt btw?
o caitlin was complaining abt the fact he was more experienced but was giving simple shit and basically not putting forth actual ideas
im doing okay, at a low point bcz of quarantine and turning to things that will help out
n i went <:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248> yall scawey
oh um basically im in an internship program thats kinda like cse110 and one of the guys in my team was being kinda not open-minded earlier
> o caitlin was complaining abt the fact he was more experienced but was giving simple shit and basically not putting forth actual ideas
<@!262847360403636224> ohhh yea idk that was wack
he was like suggesting simple projects and then being like oh yea ive worked in an ML lab for a few months now
so caitlin was like ?????
I dont understand ppl who go into group projs without being open minded like u knew this was a collaborative effort thonk
like u can have preferences n push for them a bit yes
but like also *calm*
yea its like, stubbornness and being open about your preferences is fine
but dont shut out everyone else bc you only wanna do ur idea
Idk i was telling caitlin that he might just like
Have connections into the ML lab or like may just not be creative
bc idk wat his ML lab does anyways
Maybe hes not too experienced and is just doing basic stuff at the lab who knows
yea very true
and thats fine
its a learning experience
we here to learn new skills and stuff
So def should be mindful of him being worried he might not be able to complete more difficult projs
gl tho
this isnt an insult since im not all that experienced in multiple things either but im not expecting a ton from anyone on the team really
yea i feel like no one is expecting anyone to know a lot
tmr ill prob ask epople about the extent of their knowledge
bc its a relatively beginner internship
bc like
yall learn together kinda thing
of our team of 5, theres me caitlin who are 3rd years, 2 2nd year guys, and a 4th year girl who was gone for the afternoon so idk much about her
so like
<@!303002872646467596> o shit are you at snow?
nononono LOOL
where at
this is monkeys
my intern project is solo
ucsd's supercomputer center is running this program!!
its like team of 5, make a product and learn how to work in an agile framework
but as i was saying
but ye if it helps / if its wat ur team feels more comf doing u could def do one of the simpler projs he suggested and then add more features to it given time
i dont think people have taken many upper divs,,,,
That way those who arent as experienced dont feel overwhelmed by it
ahahha
yea ig
i just think its too simple for the amount of time we're putting into a project
yea depends on how experienced / knowledgeable ur team is ig
bc i could see chatbot taking the whole time if u add difficult features
esp if theyre beginner like
If they only took up to cse12 or smthn idk
wat u could do is also break down a more difficult proj into achievable milestones kinda thing
And then get as far as u can
So like minimum achievable milestone is say a chatbot
If yall have time
ehhhh me and caitlin dont wanna do it anyways
its supposed to be for hdh's website
like that was the target
so idkkk
u can transform it to a ML one
ahh
lmao my wifi is being a piece of shit
but ye jus ideas yall can implement so both yall and ur groupmates agree with the difficulty and workload
> wat u could do is also break down a more difficult proj into achievable milestones kinda thing
<@!262847360403636224> yea for sure
bc sounds like yall might be more experienced than them
this be the point of the sprints
yee uwu
<@!303002872646467596> oof im sorry that happened to you =/ rip i hope you get through it swiftly still
it be like that when you work in teams :')) but it did more or less resolve itself so it all good!!
yeahh
respect is really important in a team
he needs to recognize you guys as equal/smarter at the least
hes a lil 2nd year :3
<:pepescared:716190404642340924>
forreal tho he got a lot better by the end of the day
hi chwis <:PepeHeart:567839212557172737>
hi
i think if they recognize the level of knowledge you guys posses then he should be driven to pick your brains and learn as much as possible
but i just read the last like 30 mins of messages so idk the whole story
o ok i just saw an important message lol yeah i guess mans just needs to be more open minded, its literally a skill to work with others well
we good now tho he started putting out ideas and expanding them as well
<:hypers:471374617337135134>

ima be honest lmaoo
well not asleep asleep but like laying down eyes closed half listening
i love ryan but i dont think its physically possible to sit there for 1.5 hours straight listening to him talking about his experience without finding urself nodding off
<:FeelsBadMan:441463646124507136>
<:oofsu:588259459126657037>
esp since his experience is in game design and its not something im super interested in pursuing
And I‚Äôm southbound to SD
ooo
i wana visit sd <:FeelsBadMan:441463646124507136>
half the ppl r there
i havent napped with another human being in months
except caitlin except shes not really human
shes like 94% snake
also yall i had this weirdly realistic dream before dinner
Where my mom said dinner would be porridge
Ndthni woke up for dinner
And it was noodles
And i was like ? where is the porridge
and my mom was like ????
and i was like ???????????? <:huh:442185049870434307>
n then i asked *then when r we eating porridge*
and my mom went ?????????????????????? <:huh:442185049870434307>
Understandable
and now im sad
bc i like porridge
Its like rice but its also soup but its like rice with all the advantages of soup
Like not having to chew <:kirblush:613942747224604702>
i dont like chewing i get tired after a while

<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
what's the point of sleeping early when I still wake up feeling terrible D:
because  your body needs to get adjusted to the new sleep schedule and amount of sleep you're getting
you can't just fix yourself off one good sleep cycle
<:FeelsBadMan:441463646124507136>
tru but issok, y'know when you wake up feeling terrible but when you actually like get out of bed and get started on your day, you feel better üôÇ
but also gm
lmaoo these 9ams be like
how long can i snooze
but everytime i snooze
no snooze <:angrydoggo:600915014781501460>
i have a high risk of not waking up again
I woke up at 7am lmao
F
issok after this week, we don't have to be up at 9 am anymore <:kek:490008924414803968>
just counting down the days at this point
damn, im going to be lonely in the morning again <:PepeHands:504520804466163732>
D:
sowwey
we will have daily meetings in the morning tho, just not as early at 9
‚ù§Ô∏è
i love how i wake up at 9 thinking its early when i used to wake up at 6:30 am every day lol
tfw when after 7 years you finally have a good sleep schedule but all your friends don't have one so you just stand there like patrick waiting for spongebob until they wake up after 11am  <:xd:612726759846051861>

<@!446932571192819713> o rly?
ah i see
üôÇ
<@!303002872646467596> you'll just have daily meetings with your team and scrum master, other than that, just get your shit done ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
and the daily meetings should be like 10 mins
^
Varies by team
Our team is experienced, with minimal oversight
So we just slack each other every now and then
<@446932571192819713> <@303002872646467596> where are you interning?
ucsd supercomputer center
Ah nice
the program is kinda like cse110
like its like
developing a project
That's typical
You rarely get internships where you integrate into an existing team
Those are golden though
(had one like that last summer)
Hilariously last summer I ended up contributing to another intern project from my main team
ya itll be a good time i think

<:yeet:442868651792793601>

i haven't ask Ryan to look at our user stories and tasks but I could ask him to right now if you'd like
caitlin said she got like 50 questions to expand their thing
she said she got feedback on both ideas and user storiess
i mean as long as we arent behind/missing anything its chillin

NAPTIME
facts
reeee
ok like
y'all wanna do the app right?
im ok w skincare or prompt 1
aight
but the last prompt doesnt seem as interesting imo
but idk too much abt it
but its watever everyone else wants to do
bc ik jiaxuan only talks about
the prompts
like the sdsc ones
so like hmmm
we'll just see wat the group decides
i have preferences but they arent like super strong preferences to one specific app
kinda thing
this is *communism*
<@!105463401056071680> wat do u prefer
i opened ttalk to see communism
love that
<:communism:638784374388555798>
<:kek:490008924414803968>
idk
im actually
more curious on how the mapping is
its more techncial sounding
lool one of our teammates was like i wanna do prompt 1 or 6 of ryans prompts
and im like
wtf is this
wtf is that
sounds mega big bwain
and os and hardware component stuff is pretty cool
im down for mapping but not the stack visualizer
the stack visualizer he made it seem like
very not interesting lowkey
mapper might be easier than skincare
bc skincare idk how far we will get
i mean
idk
i have no idea how the mapper is
seems like networking stuff
which is
It looks like a data structure kinda thing
pretty annoying
networking is cancer kek
but good on resume
KEK
Das tru
All the networking i know is ubiquti <:pepehands:464568955533524992>
Idk any <:kek:490008924414803968>
It sounds interesting im down for it
Lowkey ryans explanation of it the other day didnt do it justice
So who knows maybe the stack visualizer would be nice too
Yeah
I mean at a point i zoned out
So like kek
He made it seem v basic imo
theres not enuf cheese in my loaded fries
*sad*
Networking is a weird realm for me
Both as an econ major and pre-law student

<a:monkaCough:713632323995959376>
There's such thing?
good moaning
unnnNNNNNNNNNNHHHHHHHHH
hnghh
this is random but what‚Äôs the likelihood of ucsd classes being COMPLETELY remote
close to none
kinda high ngl, but they do say they are going to be doing testing relatively frequently
oh
nvm
i-
for fall at least
winter is a diff story
idk what's going to happen to winter
it really depends on how the situation develops
^
if anything they might transition fall to fully online, then winter back but who knows
aren't they reopening rimac soon
bc i‚Äôm still like . so do i dorm? do i get an off campus apartment? like <a:pepehell:717609408057573466> <a:pepehell:717609408057573466> <a:pepehell:717609408057573466> <a:pepehell:717609408057573466>
hell all the dumbasses may just forcew california to reopen anyways
money wise if i was in your shoes i'd either stay home or get an off-campus apt
if youre comfortable with it, you can always get a friend and fill a room that someone is subleasing
idk there's something about on campus apt's that just hit different you know
at least for the first year
but if you're leaving home for the freedom, which honestly i get, on-campus would be the way to go for your first year bc you have some support from the school
there're '24s in here?
yup
huh
yes
sandy
a couple
> there're '24s in here?
<@!134874605121699840>  theres at least 5
Yeah unless you get Douglas apts in which case definitely go off campus lol
But you're Muir so on campus is nice for you
Also right by the coast

> but if you're leaving home for the freedom, which honestly i get, on-campus would be the way to go for your first year bc you have some support from the school
<@!493178993814798346>  but like if i dont get a housing contract<:okjim:694657767230931055>
they became the general ucsd discord
^
because the original general ucsd discord was overrun
But you're a freshmen youll probably get one
yup so Racoon dungeon is ummm interesting
f
they might let freshies live on campus but like only doubles and singles?
they do and theyre capping it
i lurk in rc and its basically '24 2.0

3/4th of my friend group is now from the bay
tell me y tf i hear tiktok music from my moms phone
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
bnecause they take actual music
and put them into their tik toks <:xd:612726759846051861>
no it was like the one specific portion of a song used in tiktoks
And only that portion
*scawey*
oh no this doesn't bode well
shes Hip and With The Times
Imagine using _tik tok_
I've never gone on tik tok but i've been sent tik toks so i've watched some
most of them are too cringe and my boomer sense of humor doesn't understand most of it
my entire youtube recommended is just bad tiktok compilations it's honestly kinda sad
lmao it honestly do be that sometimes
Idek how to describe my utube recs
its like a mix of gamer and weeb shit
mine is music (covers/long compilations of like lofi songs) or gaming
i get a disproportionate amount of gaming videos for someone who doesn't game
i think youtube is convinced i play league
LOL
types league once in google to see what it is
google: alright time to recommend them league everywhere

there's guns
blazing
in my hood
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
What
Again
i need a bulletproof bmw now
I swear its just fireworks
I heard them down near kearny mesa too
nah nah fireworks go PPSSSHH NEEEEWWWWWEEEEEARRR BOOM
I know some cities have firearm detection systems
this was just BOOMM echo echo echo
<:bigyeet:713268953564315699>
And they have to test them
<:sweat:713285695694831647>
guns go boom boom
Some do
a typical day of practicing the second amendment
<:xd:612726759846051861>
uh oh <:shook:606018427018149889>
<a:monkaCough:713632323995959376>
did you know the govt is selling high grade fireworks to teens
THEY'RE WHAT?
<:YOUWHAT:714649912410898514>
its a fun time to be alive
The government sold of humvees to whoever at first
Without removing body armor
those high grade fireworks are guns right
wat
no literal fireworks
Let's blow up the Capitol guys!!
I remember seeing an auction in Houston
it's high grade for a reason i would assume
<a:PepePopcorn:554328145344462848>
it would be in yeehaw
<:monkaYeehaw:717287694283046945>
These days all the Humvees are stripped when they are sold
like the ones used in amusement parks and such
Which is boring
like big loud boom
will make your whole street beep
an armored vehicle sounds like something thats in demand rn
<:sweat:713285695694831647>
Let's start a Zoomer rebellion and shoot fireworks at Boomers
<a:PepePopcorn:554328145344462848>
i think we're doing that rn
In Houston the police bought some
except it's somewhat different
The national guard didn't need them they sold a bunch too
Somebody in my housing development had one
<a:PepePopcorn:554328145344462848>
military industrial complex at its finest
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
This is why we defund the police
lets form well-regulated militias
oh more new ppl welcome
This

Is roughly what they had
But it was in gulf war era colours
Yikes
Playing soldier spells trouble
<:blobshrug:360216835083337731>
We had a neighbourhood militia that formed during Hurricane Harvey
Which was fairly common
well
it
Technically not really in Texas
You aren't allowed to subvert anything under a state of emergency
The state police were just barging into developments
Welcome new peeps <:banzai:442185100273123328>

oh linkedin
i
used to think
linkedin was linkedln
..
Linked List
>.>
its LinkedIn
üôÇ
<:GWslippyPeepoW:407618454061842433>
LinkedIn
Mine is so depressingly empty
<@!151123898698563584> <@!303002872646467596> did yall put software engineer intern or developer intern for linkedin
i jus want an internship :((
bc it kinda sounds more like swe?? but he calls anyone thats not a pm a dev
imagine updating your linkedin
*jenny wat r we*
devs ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
so we should put Developer Intern
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
sure
i see some ppl from the internship putting software engineer so i was confused
o
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
bc the trio put devs but it seems like everyone else called it soft. engineer
so idk wtf is going on
LMAOO
<@!262847360403636224> software engineer, but with internship field checked
<:pepehands:464568955533524992> *wat am i*
huh
wym internship field checked
saw this on other people's linkedins
Like the level?
yeah
o
> you're too cool for me
<@!173261056225837056>  no u
it's clearly an internship anyway, so there's no point in wasting words
wait
wat
it's a three month summer gig, and you haven't graduated yet
imagine having stuff on your linkedin
SWE > Developer, unless you're doing front end
nothing on my linkedin
is relevant
same
besides for from hs
front end is tricky
and that was when i wanted to be premed

like this?
I havent put the description yet
but ye
or do i put "Software Engineer Intern:
yeah
I need to update mine
doing it slowly
i need to update mine but
im too lazy
D:
then I'm going to propagate it to my resume
for spring apps
uuuugh
we dont put intern?
don't put intern in title
but in our profile headline thing we do right
I put software dev when I worked there, since the title is technically a dev intern
go with student in headline tbh
honestly titles don't matter
iufvhnir
I'm not putting CISO Backend Software Engineering Intern on my resume. It's too wordy
InfoSec Software Engineer on LinkedIn is enough
maybe InfoSec Software Engineer (Intern) on my resume
lmao
yeet
so should i put Software Engineer or Software Developer? bc i see a lot of people listing it as Software Engineer and i originally thought it was Software Developer
Software Engineer is better imho
if you want to target engineering-heavy
or ig the big question is
*does it matter which i put am i just tripping over nothing*
not really
TBH Engineer just sounds better
more rigorous
(also something that's not allowed in certain countries)
(unless you graduated from a Certified Engineering Program)
(so yay?)
Doesn‚Äôt really matter, but I just like to stick to what the role actually is
really a matter of preference tbh
I standardize on Engineer since I like it
y is updating my linkedin so hard
reeeeeeeeee
i need a new picture
:hands
ikr
lightly edited
all hail the Algorithm

<@!262847360403636224>  i'm calling it swe b/c that's the role we technically applied for
plus it sounds better than just developer imo
im looking at the sdsc ppl on linkedin
n its split 50/50
so fuck it
https://www.linkedin.com/in/afzhou/
\o/
üëÄ
gna go find more ppl on linkedin now
KEK

LMAOOO

i dont ahve that many
:o

alex y r u looking at my linkedin

oop
tyty
o fuck

i havent done that yet
ye so like instead of `Introduction to Discrete Mathematics (CSE 20)` put `Discrete Mathematics (CSE 20)`
i needa update my resume
I don't bother with course numbers
nobody has time to look at course numbers
reeeeeee ill update my linkedin with my resume once i have shit to write in the description for the current internship
Unless you're targeting a UCSD career fai, and even *then*
wat font size is good for resume mine was at like 11
11/12
a good test is to try skimming it at arms length
this isn't to simulate the size
but to simulate comprehension
Mm probably <#661466804996276224>

UPS delivered something I ordered days after

that rings like a doc3 research questino
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
our ib program is really small so
also if u were in physics hl the ia solely existed to teach u how to get away w falsifying daya
*to what extent*
data

life skill
and i was nOT GOING TO DO A IB RESEARCH PAPER
wrote a 10 page essay w made up data üíØ
breh
U HAD TO DO THAT IN elementary?? A whole research paper??
AP Physics 1 and 2 sucked the life out of me
no
hs
but
ib makes u
write a research project
for every class
imagine taking physics in hs <:kek:490008924414803968> <:kek:490008924414803968>
thats supposed to take a year
guess ill die
so for physics anf math
we had to
write a research paper
> AP Physics 1 and 2 sucked the life out of me
<@!485663145583575040> i hated it
Physics was a mistake
... on math ...
shouldve taken physics C
<:GWaobloChildPepeCry:407618822489636864>
ib phys didnt even get me out if
LOL i heard like the math external (?) assessment was canceled bc corona
of
2a
Wish we had physics c<:peepocry:640363747990306827>

<:xd:612726759846051861>

<:okjim:694657767230931055>
What in the IB
omg sam
ib boy
hi
Hi
to what extent
did
iv
<a:PEPESCREAM:659115134089822288>
ib
I
there we go
You had me at to what extent
LMAOOO
I had flashbacks immediately
<:cursecat:612044490307272727>
UCSD needs to try harder though
Is IB similar to the ACT/SAT? Or completely different?
Nothing is beyond IB yet
diff
its a 2 year program
IB is very different
^
w every subject
Nvm
and a research projecy for every class
AP Bio is equiv to like
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
3 chapters of IB Bio HL?
its a diploma program
Of the...I wanna say 13?
i didnt do bio thank god
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
If I was a Bio major I'd be happy I did
But I'm not
bro some ib classes r worth it for credit
however
hota and lit
did nothing
The credits suck dick overall
idk why i was forced to do hota hl
Including what they give us in general
The *information* preparation is a different matter
i mean
if i studied
im sure that
So many smart ppl. My cue to leave <:KEKW:689560105058041995>
ib would make me successful in college
however
i did not
I‚Äôm late but stray kids <:bulbaowo:615441070033207307>
My 5 in IB HL Bio only gives me credit for BILD 10
i got my ib diploma w a one point margin
And ib <:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
But I did BILD 3 and it wasn't even beyond GCSE
imagine getting high 30s
Let alone
IB
or even 40s...
24 gang
<@!720870911745589278>  if it makes u feel better crackhead hours start soon
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
Our lowest was 24? I think
They had to repeat
i went from a 24 ib
to a 2.0 gpa first quarter
so like
3 people had to repeat as they got below a 3
ive been living that life for a minute now
The avg for my class of 53 was 33

<@!345083648124649485> wdym starting soon
And I got 33
I love crack
jk im not as awful at school anymore

36+ is enough to get u into utoronto

or waterloo
i think waterloo is 39
I think of somi somi
or smth
And cry
<:pepehands:464568955533524992>
i want somi somi
Up until 2017 it wouldn't have even gotten you into some Russel Group unis in the UK
I had somi somi a while ago
But in 2017 enrollment tanked so now a 38 will give a smole chance at Oxford or Cambridge
yea
i mean i doubt 36 was enough to
get u into
uoft stg
but def uoftsc or uoftm
38 was the minimum to apply for Oxford in 2016
40 for Cambridge
so basically wat ur saying is
if me and my friend
combined scores
we coildve gone to camrbdige
I got into honors UofT M and SC with a 33
<:blobshrug:360216835083337731>
i got ghosted by uoftstg

i lived in scarborough
and my parents still have a house there
UofT even preserved my entry during my gap year
Lol
so uoftsc wouldnt have veen
that bad
tbh
Same with northeastern actually
like i wouldve considered it
I considered UofT
They are good at similar things to what I want to do at SD
i want to do uoftstg for gead
grad
if i can
i miss toronto
so much
top tier city
I have extended family in Toronto
I know that feel
Its a nice place
my parents r like u shoukd go to uk for grad
Oh I wonder why
bc they did grad school at uni of manchester
(mine are too)
lmao
but
uh
idk bout that one
I'm tempted by UW for Grad
They have a lot of good programs and a very close relationship with UCSD
my gpa tempts me to stop thinking ab grad school
Plus my Lab includes their entire grad department
So I can probably just ask them directly?
i missed the somi somi tawk
w8 r there ml labs accepting undergrads
at ucsd
<@!181482518107783168>
i do want some taiyaki rn ngl
i genuinely
dont eveb know
how to find research
Design Lab is always taking whoever doing whatever
but i want it
r u fr
Just waltz in and pick something to do
is it like ml-related tho
oh ok bet
I mean my project is Joint CSE-Design Lab-Medical School
is it hiring
:o
Between UCSD the VA, and UW
Not anymore
rip
if it ever is pls lmk
Sure
ty ty
I got rejected from joining a second program
<:FeelsBadMan:441463646124507136>
rip
ur still ia'ing tho right
Which was design and CSE for glucose monitoring hardware
so u gotta full plate
Yeah
COGS 10
FA20
i wanna ia for 18
I have DFA as well
or 108/109
I'm a Team Lead
bc i dont think ill do well enough in 118ab to ia LOL
thats p sick acrually
I wanted to do more behavioural neuro lab work or something
But none are hiring 'cause COVID
So I'm doubling down on Design
ik there was an unpid neuro lab position w a med school prof in the fall ?
but i never got an email back ,,,
for an unpaid position ....
Yeah I had one lined up for alzheimers
wait
But they all dropped out
my friend did that one
the alzheimers
one
Yeah
Nothing is running
freshman year
and she said it was terrible
So I was like
and left
*wellp*
My ass decided Sunday night to do a 46 hour designjam
From Netflix
That sounds like a lot of our labs
In the case of Cogs
Rossano's lab
Don't touch it
Ever
man fuck it ill do anythint
anything
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
This lab has lied about research
And had sexual allegations
Big no thanks
If I wanna do animal cognition I'll just yeet to Johnson
sexual allegations
w h a t
lmao
She is probably the smartest faculty the department has now anyway...
johnson would be sick to get to know better
even if shes
terrifyinf
Johnson knows who I am I think
man
Probably because I presented her paper to a class
i emailed my ia for cogs 13
ab my grade
smartest
and he said he forwarded it to
johnson
hm?
but she jever responded
yikes
Like seriously that lady *actually* knows what cognitive science is
smartest

Disown them and adopt new sons who you will be proud of :)
wtf i could have sworn it was just 1:55
Time flies when you're not having fun üôÉ
But what is fun
And how can one have it
Fun is an intangible concept
How can you hold, or contain within your possession a state of mind
Go to bed.
Never
F is for friends who do stuff together
U is for you and me
N is for anywhere and anytime at all
go to bed
dont be like me
That song is kinda off when u break it down
If you assume the letters are mutually exclusive
Is f is for friends who do stuff together
Then you and me, who receive u aren't friends who do stuff together
And n is for anywhere and anytime so really it's a meaningless letter
If n was a math function, it'd be multiplying by 1
There's always plankton's interpretation:

F is for fire that burns down the whole town
U is for uranium, bombs
N is for no survivors when you're-
You gotta wonder though
What plankton chorus was
The original is "down here in the deep blue sea"
Sea of course rhymes with me, the end of the second line
Therefore the chorus must rhyme with bomb
Interesting challenge
I think i need to start sleeping early. Crackhead hours aint for me <:kek:490008924414803968>
Its alright my friend, crack isn't for everyone
Its not the letter n :)
That's deep fam

i feel bad for christina
üôÇ
shes been doing that
for almost
Christina is still learning
everyone
like we all are but
she asked me a lot of questions

ye
and thats all i ask for

people asking me
shes doing great
like i know shit
<:kek:490008924414803968>
is ok
theyre all learning how development works
Discording during work <:wotthink:441465363671154698>

excuse the random purple thing i put
but holy fuck
tutoring cs and my student has
SO MANY TABS
But she was so good at clicking the right one
**communication**, Ari xd
same, Joanne
Yeah I know a lot of people like that
i do that when im coding usually
You get used to icons
^
and when you keep flipping to it bc you need it, you know its placement
even when im coding, i never have more than 5-7 open max <:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
And if you do it a lot, you learn what you open first so clicking things with the same icon gets easy
my roommate had like 70 or smth once
i can be thinking about coding and i'll have more than 7
that was just  asingle window
how do you keep the number so low
idk ive never needed more than pm spec + language docs + framework docs + stackoverflow
and then a few misc stuff
i usually open a bunch
then do a full reset
once and a while
ah yes having a pm
imagine that
or like just go through and close some
<:diccothink:441464420590157824>
i don't think i've worked on a single project organized enough to have a pm
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
i mean even then
a few tutorial tabs and im still under 7 lol
/giphy
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
ari is big brain
don't listen to him
open your tabs
you do you
wat
i just get very distracted easily üò¶
so less tabs is easier for me
Yo ‚Äò24 server got a nice server icon now
o
tfw my team is working on something
but im just the PM so i can't exactly do anything/help them
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
help jenny pls
i wanna be helpful but i dont wanna distract them bc they got it
::^)
wut

oo good job
well its more of like
their "boss"
is also working on it
jenny just boss them around
bc im the boss in another aspect
tell them to work harder and faster
we elected a new boss now üôÇ
put their employment at risk
<:wotthink:441465363671154698>
for the actual product
why be the boss
when you can assign a boss
and be the boss of the boss
<:xd:612726759846051861>
<:think:613867581522313231>
_encapsulation_
I have >50 tabs at work
<:monkaS:442185930867081218>

Safari is better for debugging login flow
it's the only reason why I'll ever use safari
safari private mode sandboxes by *tab*
oh jenny yall chose the project?

okay im not going to say anything anymore :) because it actually gets me heated just know I care and that just because im not saying anything means I hate you  (that goes for everyone not just you Jenny, aka when lara shits on herself too much, I really care for you lara but sometimes seeing how much you make yourself feel like shit it angers me because I love you but its hard for you to love yourself)
that is all, i am going to close discord, see yall later tonight maybe tomorrow <3
bye ,3
‚ù§Ô∏è
love you too
i think im getting phat
I think Migual is an actual angel
JENNY
I WILL
FIGHT YOU
AS A PERSON WHO ONCE DECIDED TO GET A JOB SERVING LUNCH DURING SCHOOL WITHOUT A REAL PLAN TO EAT MY OWN LUNCH AND THEREFORE MISSED MANY MEALS AND SUFFERED BECAUSE OF MY LACK OF CARE, PLEASE TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF
OR I WILL TAKE AN UBER TO YOUR HOUSE AND FEED YOU MYSELF
ü•∫
i never ate lunch in school and that was a really bad decision so yeah dw i be eating
i just need to motivation to exercise again. also i think my stress and anxiety makes me too fucked up
its p much just my stress and anxiety
ik it can be a lot, but even taking like 30 mins a day just to have to yourself can help
just to do things like, eat food that you enjoy, vibe with some music, or just turn into a vegetable
This is bringing back memories of high school <:peepocry:640363747990306827>
high school for me was just a time that i could justify not taking care of myself bc i had things to do 24/7
high school for me was just a time that i could justify not taking care of myself bc i had things to do 24/7
<:peepocry:640363747990306827>
yeah it was really hard to grow out of working too hard
and sometimes starving myself <:pepehands:464568955533524992>
> high school for me was just a time that i could justify not taking care of myself bc i had things to do 24/7
<@!493178993814798346> thats me in hs and now üôÇ
i found out that I thrive on being busy
thats not healthy :((
its mostly
its fine
bc i can manage
but
yall need to meditate and do yoga
its not sustainable
my anxiety and stress gets to me
thats y u do meditation
and yoga
and that anxiety and stress is brought upon by other things or people
Jenny u know how u keep getting nauseous and headaches
<:uwudaddy:606017963308613636>
Im p sure this is y
^^^
well you know what they say
thats why when it gets bad , i just take some meds
üôÇ
if it doesnt spark joy üëÄ
meds bad
those are supposed to be temporary until you get back on your feet
Y take meds when u can just outright prevent it <:wuh:440237146998046730>
^^^^
are any of yall getting vitamin d
Forgotten what that feels like tbh
I‚Äôve always been eating shit but lately I‚Äôve been eating healthier than usual <:pepehands:464568955533524992>
Because I‚Äôm uhh
idk if I should say it because <:pain:713285895419330591>
But yeah one of the reasons why I always feel like shit is because of my terrible diet ahahaha
pls eat lots of veggies and stuff
Yes yes
I grew up not liking veggies so I don‚Äôt eat that much <:pain:713285895419330591>
But I‚Äôve been eating more lately
I've forgotten what vitamin d feels like tbh.

Rest is important for your physical and mental health. But we also have to acknowledge that we cannot go too far so that we're slacking and procrastinating instead üëÄ

energy drink
energy
caffeine drink ?
i like it more than reign bc its not
yes
ohp
super
sweet
like
NO I HOPE TO NEVER HAVE TO DRINK ENERGY DRINKS
reign is pure tanins
god no
eveyr other energy drink like monster, reign, redbull is sooo sweet
yerb is more tea
caffeine pills r gas
just dont sleep naturally
pfft
nop no energy drinks 4 me!
tbh ive been sleeping at 5am for the past few days i think
or 4
but last night i slept at like 2
and woke up at 6:30
i had a wall of yerbs
and idek hOw
i've been sleeping at 4 for the past few WEEKS
imagine sleeping
oof
couldnt be mee
texting ppl back that u were ta;king to at 2am
at 6:30 am
like
the thing is that there's no reason for me to be awake
"yea hi u still up"
so i just
lay
bde if theyre still up
"yea hi u still single?"
o i have parents that get angsty if i dont at least pretend to get up
then lock my door and go back to sleep
mooodddd
when i was back home i would wake up when my mom was back for her lunch break
so i would eat with her and pretend like it was my lunch too
and then yeeted into a food coma again
no locking my door tonight
i sleep downstairs
on the couch
<:cowboylookingaway:688600982212706336>
bro yes
doors
yall getting lOCKs
on your doors?
yea
but i open up
whenever they knock
i lock
and sometimes pretend i dont hear them
i have locks on my door
my parentals barge into the room far too often for there to be a lock
i lock it after i wake up from sleep paralysis
my parentals have been conditioned
<:pain:713285895419330591>
if I locked I'd probably get yelled at ngl xD
my parents dont do that <:kirbythonk:613942995628195840>
my parents ask me why its locked
^
usually im just changing or super focused on something
if I had a lock that is
i have a lock <:yeet:442868651792793601>
but angerily
no point in locking it bc my bathroom is connected to my room n my sisters
<:feelsbadman:584486296097914911>
mom just strides thru my sister's room and then straight towards mine
o
<:pain:713285895419330591>
i lock mine bc it's the closest to the front door
ohhh
so in the case we get robbed or something in the middle of the night
im not tryna be kidnapped too
o i tell my mom its jus bc sometimes im in a call w cam on
and
i would prefer to have the chance to turn off cam
today my mom went outside my closed dor
asked if it was ok to come in
!!!!
consent!!!
and swept herself inside as i relented
she asked for!!!!
oH
imagine not having your parents barge into your room?
YES BUT THE WAY SHE JUST
SHWOOP
SCARED ME
LIKE SHE WAS EXPECTING IT
SCHWWOOPS
tomer that used to happen
but w zoom etc
the asking was v nice dino
ive just been telling my parents
that im studying
on zoom
my mom used to barge into my room in the morning to yell at me <:DogKek:694453922768879646>
and regardless
asking is not a common characteristic
"studying "
its not like im doing anything nefarious
yea
i mean
we were studying in that call
but muted
so it didnt matter
but still a good excuse
how tf you "studying" summer
summer sesh
i distanced myself from my parents pretty well
and we all go to our own devices after dinner
> we were studying in that call
<@595010202613317632> u were silently annoying me
> and we all go to our own devices after dinner
<@!493178993814798346> felt that
if only
my parents complain when we all go to our own devices
my parents complain too
but then their on their devices...
there's literally nothing to do in my house
besides using the internet
mom: hay day, dad: watching youtube
for a sec
my mom: you're always on your phone!!

_Is always on her phone_
FAX
i was like tf is a hay day in viet
me n my other friend were arm gesturing at each other for minutes and u didnt notice im proud of how focused u were <@!286708165612011531>
LOL
my mom is obsessed with that game
she snatches the ipad and plays on her phone simultaneously
<@595010202613317632> i saw it but brushed it off as a friends doing friends thing i've seen weirder
o ok
are my parents
the only parents
that actively
dont use their phones?
like theyre like
phones and airpods give u brain cancer
then actually
dont use their phones
seems so
like my moms like wow my iphone 6s battery is good as new
and im like
thats bc u charge it once a week
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
my mom dad and brother all have a laptop/desktop in the living room
and then i just stay in my own room
my dad said airpods gave me brain cancer but then proceeded to buy me bluetooth earphones
<:hyperJ:694448211439648809>
<:stonks:713344926418731018>
<:stonks:713344926418731018>
<:stonks:713344926418731018>
my dad said airpods give me brain cancer then refuses to get a phone newer than the iphone 6s+ so he can use headphones w the headphone jack
like at least he's consistent
LOL yes my dad
is not consistent
i have 6plus
his arguments align when it is CONVENIENT FOR HIM
am i missing out on anything
<:huh:442185049870434307>
no
not rlly
does he not realize
aight
ding dongs exist
to convert the charging port
to the aux
yea
but
why would he
want to buy a new phone AND a dongle
when hes happy w his phone rn
thats just extra hassle
ding dongs LOL
to flex
oh right apple doesn't give you a ding dong anymore
they omitted ding dongs
on all new iphones
JASPERRRR

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
i dont even understand this prompt
yeah dw we didnt either
we went over it like 4 different timex
times*
but also i have soem slight spite for teresa
D:
issok as long as you still love me, alex and shih wen <:kek:490008924414803968>
ofc ‚ù§Ô∏è
tbh i havent
eaten anything
so like
i wanted to go first
jenny
please
xd
also
my mom
made me coffee
and uh
i needa go fix it
lol
SPEEEEDY Jenny
is this guy the one who was being a bitch
i was like
**imma go first**
yes
but issok
he listens to me
is he also teresa's friend
Nyooooom
ey ok thats good
hes not too bad as a product owner i think
bc shih wen mentions things and he is willing to listen
Gl on the beep boop idk what the words that were said but it sounds time consuming
<@!262847360403636224> tbh you keep him in check <:kek:490008924414803968>
~~can i leave and grab food~~
xd
Are there webcams?
not mandatory üòâ
OMG
If no then you can always leave and grab food <:think:613867581522313231>
JEFFFFFF
<:GotGrapes:604860898104049664>
<:kek:490008924414803968>
damn it really be like that
that just sounds so hard
i just say random shit
that prompt indeed is a bunch of words
bc he keeps saying shit based on his own experience
n im like
ok but listen here
im dumb
LMAOOO
BONGOCAT
he knows too much
but hes a real backend person im p sure
so are y'all going to  get carried through your prompt?
~~aka he has no creativity whatsoever~~
like hopping in the back pack?
y i k e s
no one else says much but no one know much
so im like
i mean if they get carried, they can just chill and learn <:kek:490008924414803968>
;;;;
ya lets uhhh consider this bc im dumb
tbh
LMAOO
backpack gang!
shih wen
like
if he just carries y'all
y'all can just do the easier tasks
xd
TAMAGOTCHI
HAHAHA
ya i think we're gna end up doing the easier tasks bc he sounds like hes jus gna zoom thru the hard ones
n im like oop
thats fine
unless
you wanna
build the entire
data structure
<:kek:490008924414803968>
there are easy tasks in comp sci?
hf with your nodes
hmmm
oh for sure
i mean i wana learn shit but i can still do that from wat hes doing
**genuine**
he'd just be teaching us instead of us learning tgthr
mhm
ig...
LMAOO
tru
issok
just
ask him questions
learn
suck the knowledge out of him üòâ
we'll prob still end up learning and doing new shit it just wont be the super complex ones
and he gave y'all a lot of guides, were they helpful?
i mean
at least
you'll be learning a new language or whatever
twas aighty
wtf am i hearing btw
but i knew like very basics
so
tbh it seems like the direction we're going in is we're all gna get split work relatively equally but its gna take a few of us longer than the estimated time to finish the proj
yeah thats what usually happens
ye
he'll prob finish before the estimated time / finish early
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
theres some stuff he doesnt know
so we'll see
but if he does he can just chill ig or start his next task so he doesnt end up doing 90% of the work
KEK
i can
pair y'all up if that happens maybe
if you wanna learn
i can just pair y'all up on some tasks and just learn with him or somethinbg
i was thinking the harder stuff we'd prob be best pairing anyways KEK
force y'all into a zoom meeting xd
idk everyone's knowledge right now tbh
bc 3 seniors
2 juniors
and a 2nd year ü§î
tfw kunal knows more thna alex and i combined
nah
hes just good at organizing
and talking

he
<:kek:490008924414803968>

yee
bc i can't do much dev shit
kek

<:FeelsBadMan:441463646124507136>
LMAOO
wait

<:thonk:440231969796784128>
<:pepehands:464568955533524992>
nah
you got it
teresa
doesnt talk that much either
so likle
Im just keeping him in check if hes taking over whole proj
~~you can control her too~~
üôÇ
LMAO WAIT
you can definitely control hger
her
im not kidding btw
they're all very
its literally kunal shih wen him and me that talk kek
quiet
we get it my full time job is manipulating people
shes quiet
most talkative in that order
and doesnt know much
üôÇ
except for data analysis
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
i mean she knows a little of neural networks
<:thonk:440231969796784128>
but tbh idk what shes doing in this internship as a data analyst
~~she couldnt get any other one~~
üôÇ
<:bigyeet:713268953564315699>
<:pepehands:464568955533524992>
thats us tho
thats us
but like
<:PEPESCREAM:466446495747670027>
we're gonna be that
you're 3rd years
going into 3rd*
we get it were old
<:pepehands:464568955533524992>
nah
it means
we're still dumb
:^)
<:KEKW:689560105058041995>
nah im like chilling lmaoo like i lowkey know how to go about controlling the flow of our group + im highkey a manipulative person in general KEK
you finally finished your classes that you needed to start doing internships
they finished
a year ago
and here they are
so like
yikes
ye
im relying on shih wen to manipulate the group for me
kek
im too lazy for this shit
i let her self destruct in my group kek
tbh it sounds like jiaxuan might be interested in working for sdsc or some shit
yeah
tru
honestly wasnt worth my effort in manipulating her
he wants the connections at the very least
mhm
yeee
So it makes sense for him to be in the internship
the stuff he does
Bc he looks like hes looking to land amthn
didnt yall say hse a kissup to ryan
or something
seems like sdsc stuff
Who‚Äôs taking summer classes?
nah not really hes actually just interested in the stuff
he just talks a lot around ryan
uh ig
prob bc ryan knows abt rhe stuff
he doesnt give a shit about ryan tbh
normally when ryan comes we just let him talk to ryan <:kek:490008924414803968>
he wants the sdsc engineers
yea hes asked like 4 times abt them
<:thonk:440231969796784128>
i told him ryan was a dev, and he was like nah hes just a manager
and im like
ok but like he knows more shit than you, now stfu
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
<@!105463401056071680> im only ‚Äúcontrolling‚Äù him if he tries to take over the whole proj KEK
yee
he prob won't, just pls don't be afraid
to ask him questions
if you ask him questions
I like to let people work and go with the flow and only take charge if i disagree w it
he'll explain everything to you
ye
if you dont ask
he'll just stay quiet
thats why i told him to send y'all the guides and stuff
if i tell him to do stuff, he'll do it and thats prob the best we can ask for
he prob wont bc he seems too nonconfrontational abt it
yea its watever
mhm
once we got this proj he got a lot better abt being open
asians are nonconfrontational unless u get to a supermarket
:&)
<:pepeClown:725782107653406770>
jokes on u im nonconfrontational always
<:KEKW:689560105058041995>
yeah but im jking
y directly confront someone when u can just manipulate them into doing wat u want
he should be fine
wait
<:wotthink:441465363671154698>
LOL
i kinda like our group dynamic tho
LMAO
WAIT FACTS
like w/ him involved
also, ive always been confrontational so thats why i wanted to be a PM
üôÇ
bc i feel like he drives it w his knowledge of the stuff
<:kirbygun:613942917135990803>
If it makes sense
mhm
jenny gonna 1v1 all of us
<:monkaS:442185930867081218>

but i also applied for cse tutor fall and if i get that i might just do cse tutor + ra fall and hope my gpa doesnt tank
bc cse tutor would also be smthn nice to add to resume <:kirblush:613942747224604702> and overall just a decent paying job
did you get cse tutor?
and yeah cse tutor is actually op
they didnt come out yet i think
one of the best jobs you can get on campus i think
bc
it pays well
and you get your own networking events
si pays the same
but ye
??
cse should pay more
Cse tutor just more in line
Cse tutor is 19/hr no?
same as si
19.07 i believe
for si
ye

adobe PS has such a steep learning curve i respect people who use it LOL
procreate <:bulbaowo:615441070033207307>
i should get procreate
should i buy an apple pencil just so i can start on procreate
what model ipad do u have
procreate is worth the $10

<:pepehands:464568955533524992>
time to move to procreate
yall fancy asf
I just use paint.net
and sai
<:kek:490008924414803968>

i also used gimp

drawing
or image editing
Whichever

> should i buy an apple pencil just so i can start on procreate
<@!580246928596664321>  PROCREATE IS AMAZING PLS
i love it sm
i use it for all of my graphic design stuffz bc it‚Äôs a lot cheaper than PS <:kek:490008924414803968>
ps expensive
ps free if pirated
<:kek:490008924414803968>
nah but ive also heard a lot of good things abt procreate
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>

<@!87652481768620032>
?
should i consider apple pencil <:thinkies:713308987843674153> 
im thinking bout csp but if i want full features it costs like around $240
but an apple pencil is ~$100 but i dont see the point of me using it because i prob only use it for drawing
i just wanted the color of the tag
let me live!!!!!!! :^(
<:peepocry:640363747990306827>
im now a sixth student
unless i get booted from ra
no im still an honorary sixth student considering the amount of time i spent there <:peepocry:640363747990306827>
Tis sounds more like a traitor's requiem. Must be the work of an enemy stand user
KEK
i am warren-marshall-sixth
So it's the same type of stand as U C B
KEK
<:xd:612726759846051861>
aedan i think that if you‚Äôre just using it for drawing there are plenty of other good options besides apple pencil so :3 bc i was considering not getting the apple pencil too
even though not getting apple pencil is prob the more cost effective option
csp is expensive <:peepocry:640363747990306827>
or i can spam trials
<:xd:612726759846051861>
time to make hundreds of trash gmail accounts
get an apple pencil then use it for notes too
<:birb:636686833002217492>
just take nicks apple pencil
*then itll be free*

He was like *dont tell miles i did this*
"degrees are for kids"
<:xd:612726759846051861>
bc miles told him to stop giving answers
<@!446932571192819713> i lost cuz i got kicked from the game halfway thru LOL

his hw is super fuckin hard
but his tests are chill
Welp I‚Äôm dying
his hw is rly hard bc he believes in learninf from hw
but i 100% prefer hard hw bc i learn by doing hw
ok
But his tests r fair id say
BET
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
but he provides a lot of OH for hw support
Like his OH is basically
‚ÄúWhich hw problem r we going over today‚Äù
i heard his 20c tests are pretty hard but it's good for its difficulty?
n then he basically does it for u while walking thru it to help u understand
tbh hard tests arent bad if the whole class fails
but thats for cse20 so idk if it applies for math
yea
im taking it
him
for cse20
Oo
<:pepehands:464568955533524992>
im praying i do well in his class tho

<@!493178993814798346> YOU ... ARE GENIUS
i have life 360 active
because they don't know how technology works
üíî
^^
wtf
unfortunately my dad is a tech junkie
y'all got life360 too?
like earlier today my mom was wondering why she keeps seeing the question marks with a square
LOL
> y'all got life360 too?
<@!118383691327078407> yES
tf is this
i literally went to my friends house and my dad got mad at me for not turning it on LMAO
and my sister was explaining to her about not being updated to the latest ios
i just have find my friends with my parentals so it's not too hard
thats so weird
i showed it to my mom and like
lol my parents dont use tech they just call me 247
and my mom was still asking why LMAO
there's never a time where i don't get a phone call from her when im out
but im pretty sure you can use like an ipad or smth with the same account and move the tracker
my parents recently got into a habit
of texting me
i text my parents where i'm at time to time
"when you come home??"
while im in the same house
but they rarely reply
as them
akljfhalwiuefhlkajsdhf
r u rlly viet if u don't check ur phone for 10 min and look to see 27 missed calls and voicemails, with all of them saying "neu ma may ko ve tao dap chet me may"

<@!286708165612011531> NO MY MOM JUST GOES: Why you don't pick up my call??
the strictest parents make the most rebellious kids
idk my parents don't bother contacting me unless they don't see me for a couple days
i pass my wisdom to yall
BUT YOU DIDNT HEAR THIS FROM ME
even when i wasn't doing anything wrong
my parents don't care what i do as long as i'm with friends
i still felt guilty
<:kek:490008924414803968>
like
what
my parents rarely contact me when i'm at school
legit the only thing i get from them are pictures of food they made
i stayed at school til 4 for decathlon every weekday and my mom still was sus
and only contact me to pick me up
tbh i feel like my mom texts me in a funny way
or if they need something
my parents dont care too much anymore about what i do bc i stopped coming home on the weekends
and i went to study sessions every weekend at other teammates' houses and they thought i was LYING
my mom spaces her periods for some reason
idk why
and im also contractually obligated to go back to them at some point
so they're letting me fly rn
my mom either sends pictures or calls
she can't text
> i stayed at school til 4 for decathlon every weekday and my mom still was sus
<@!286708165612011531> SAME they say u don't have to study that much if u were doing well and smart

but i suck at french and can't speak chinese
<:zoop:435223493311725573>
<@118383691327078407> res hall life flashbacks haunt me once again with cv burgers <:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
oo my paternal grandparents knew mandarin, canto, a lil eng, viet, teo chew, and some other chinese dialects
i think my gma knew 7 languages
I learned tagalog when I went to middle school in the Philippines for 2 years

TEO CHEW

LOL
i think i went to school in the philippines for a few months
Oof, that's a long way to the microwave
because i pretty much lived there for almost a year

if i wanted to cook id have to go to argo
*prison
OH I think my grandpa too
<@405810391025713156> was it international or full on tagalog?
i don't remember
i was like 4 or 5 LMAO

Ooo lolol because I went in 7th grade and failed every tagalog class <:yeet:442868651792793601>

The fact that they're not vegetables üò†

y cant they be both
*intersectionality*
üò†
gather hither my doc friends
<@!173261056225837056>
who said spring onions are c tier
WHO SAID THAT
If we do not have a clear divide on what a vegetable and a fruit is, then I don't think we can have peace
<:feelsrevengeman:713649980799189003>
KEK
GREEN ONIONS GOOD
theyve clearly never had good soup in their entire lives
REEE
y must there be a divide!!!!!!
people can identify as multiple things
by categorizing them as one, we r limiting its potential!!!!!!
and putting them at a disadvantage
also who said pumpkin is a vegetable
by categorizing them!!
yea was confused on that too
let the tomatoes decide what they are
^
It can have the same potential, but it can't be on the veggie S tier list
let the tomato be a fruit AND a vegetable
JUST BC ITS BOTH DOESNT MEAN ITS ANY LESS OF A VEGETABLE
!!!!!!!
why are tomatoes S tier
where's the fruit tier list
FRUIT TIER LIST
Ok. What if, we had a table. 2 sides of the table. We wrote "fruit" on one side, "vegetable" on the other side. Hold the tomato near the table, and see where it chooses to go
now we have to have a fruit tier list
third favorite fruit tier list
u have to make it 4 dif sides
_wait_
What is the most reliable fruit?
fruit, vegetable, both, none
what is the most reliable fruit
apples
hmm
a pineapple tbh
like it always
I've never had a bad ripe banana
tastes like
the same
LMAO
o you mean that kind of reliable
pineapples can be bad
ive never had a weird tasting pineapple
apples are just versatile as heck
They can be like really stiff
rly
never had a problem w my pineapples
hmm
I'm actually sort of allergic to apples, so I can't choose apples
you know what's a reliable fruit
lemons
true
i've never had a non sour lemon
ur rigt
tru
lemons always got your back when its sour time
<:thowonking:712569034209493042>
what about... pears?
Pears are just as reliable as apples
wait a second
what kind of pears
lemons are so good
I like brown pairs the most
lemonade people

and you use it on fish
Hm
korean pears hit differently
tru
cant go back to regular pears anymore
american pears are gross
american? white people pears?
idk lol

if u get wat i mean
apples are like the one fruit i‚Äôm not allergic too
damn what about persimmons

Ari for owner
<:realthink:455509896662876162>
a fruit tier list now must happen
tropical fruits >>>>>
but like
what do u rate fruits on
yumminess only/
?
durian can be S tier
how hard it is to eat, versatility?
hmmm what else
longevity?
mango S+ tier don't @ me
i would find apples and oranges as an automatic S tier
skeptical about kiwis though
Everyone should be mod
So we can all moderate ourselves
No
It‚Äôs _our_ server
*soviet anthem intensifies*
<:communism:638784374388555798>
> longevity?
<@!485663145583575040>  ^^^ yeah get fucked avocados
I like avocados
Yum
but... i love advocads <:peepocry:640363747990306827>
Avocados are good but their desperation to brown as fast as possible prevents them from achieving top tier fruitilage via the longevity trait
alright
im making
the fruits form rn
so we can all fill it out
is it for the fruits raw or microwaved <:sidethink:440232037056512000>
I think also a trait to consider is how many different ways can we eat the fruit
Versatility trait
YEAH ok Nina said versatility
I feel like how well it can be juiced (juiceability
j00se
coconut is fr00t? 0:
for me itd be ranked rlly low not bc it's not tasty but bc it's hard to crack
and access the milk and meat
well it sure aint a vegg <:cursedab:640362029609385995>
too much work imo
> Versatility trait
<@!245736329382461440> i think versatility is too narrow with fruits tho tbh
most of them are, like,
Raw
or in a Smoothie
but you can choose to consider it in ur own ratings
best fruit is tomato
because it is not a fruit
Pastries and pies
ITS OVER FOR ME

I want chocolate chip cookies <:FeelsBadMan:441463646124507136>
Bake some owo
im not allowed to make stuff unless under supervision
just kidding i technically am but really shouldnt be
At this point my mom is like *if she burns down the house, she can pay for it herself*
:((
ever since i microwaved aluminum foil, i have asked for directions around the kitchen out of obligation and fear
and have probably eaten a lot of undercooked food
Oh no
It‚Äôs ok at least u haven‚Äôt burned milk in the microwave
u can burn milk? <:yeet:442868651792793601>
ive only burnt coffee
Idk maybe some people can <:yeet:442868651792793601>
but yea u know how everyone has that *one* thing they cant do no matter how smart or talented or hardworking they r
*cooking is mine*
Also are we using baby pics as pfps now
Oh boy
i been using it <:kirblush:613942747224604702>
Bruh Ik I have one
I don‚Äôt remember it off the top of my head
like i mean im stupid but in the kitchen i am EXTRA stupid
<:kek:490008924414803968>
half the time i still burn eggs <:FeelsBadMan:441463646124507136>
ORIGAMI
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm terrible at
idk how its like fine one moment..: then burnt the next
And uh gardening too
im too impatient for gardening
I think it‚Äôs the opposite
You garden to train your patience
origami is ok but it turns out ugly <:kek:490008924414803968>
but it doesnt work bc u give up bc ur impatient
<:FeelsBadMan:441463646124507136>
OH THATS IT
Painting
I‚Äôve tried so many times throughout my life
But I cannot for the life of me paint myself out of a cardboard box
understandable
Like some pencil doodling sure but
Painting a person is hard
Painting? Noooo way
I couldn‚Äôt even paint a straight line if my arm was 1 dimensional
painting is weird bc ive lowkey never figured out the whole color combo thing
<:kek:490008924414803968>
like ik red and blue make purple and blue and yellow make green and red and yellow make orange
But thats abt it...
but then ppl combine like purple and red or white and orange and im like ???????
You should play around with an rgb color wheel
rgb color wheel fun
idk wat im doing half the time tho
Same
At least music comes somewhat naturally to me
I never really practiced or studied as much as I should‚Äôve tho
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
music is fun bc i just make a lot of sounds as a person in general
sometimes i come out of the shower and im like ROOOOOOOOOAR
n it just makes so much sense at the time
but then my mom thinks im stupid
but its true i am in fact stupid <:kirblush:613942747224604702>
I like sounds <:kirblush:613942747224604702> esp when they come together n sound cool
Haha sound go üîä
sound is nice bc it creates more sound <:kirblush:613942747224604702> like how when u bang the pots together as a kid u make clanging sounds and then it creates sounds of crying and whipping as ur mom beats u for ruining her pots <:kirblush:613942747224604702>

im learning JS and node js rn
ew js
good to know tho
good stuff üëå
Ew js
Good to know, though
But remember: JS ignores established, sane software engineering reality... And replaces it with its own.
^^^
but so many companies use it lol
js just feels like yucky java
js is pretty useful for projects like this ig
lol
like in 110 it was p useful since u could use the same language across frontend backend and everything
also all the labs were p much in js
full-stack js??
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>

*NO*
<:wotthink:441465363671154698>
wait what tutorial is it shihwen

Codeacademy js
Its so long <:pepehands:464568955533524992>
I have stopped to be fed
oh yes codeacdemy
react and node are also on there btw
mom put the bread away from me <:peepocry:640363747990306827>
wow rly
codecademy has come far lol
When I used it, it only had like
python and web dev stuff
when they added java a few years ago, it felt revolutionary to me lol
ya its a decent lesson ig
same level as a lot of their other lessons
code wise its p basic but i think it does give a decent overview of major concepts
Ive done some js looong ago and its also extremely close to java imo
So it just feels kinda slow
n tedious
def good for beginner programmers tho
update was very excited to get porridge
slorp porridge
Porridge hot <:FeelsBadMan:441463646124507136>
tongue n throat *die*
o h LMAO
is u okkkk
yes i like porridge <:kirblush:613942747224604702>
Its like rice but also like soup
but like i dont have to chew
<:kirblush:613942747224604702>
it also do the burn
burn is temporary, porridge is forever <:wuh:440237146998046730>
<:oh:718320846279540787>
<:kirblush:613942747224604702>
> burn is temporary, porridge is forever <:wuh:440237146998046730>
<@!262847360403636224> not when it comes back out another way
<:yeet:442868651792793601>
<:PEPESCREAM:466446495747670027>
btw i take back what i said about node on codecademy
its technically there
but beyond the overview you need the premium thing
but if you need/want to learn a bit i can send u the lab from 110 that covered node LOL
ah yes
110 labs are
very informative
LOL i did say "learn a bit"

Unless it‚Äôs thin crust

Thin is valid
Thin is valid but I get less crust for my money and thats not very

wait question
if we go down to the dorms in the fall what are they gonna do when we come back from thanksgiving break ...
Depends on what winter brings
Half of /r/UCSD is convinced they're catfishing you guys with the dorms. For all we know things might get worse and campus gets abandoned again.
Things are already getting worse
> Half of /r/UCSD is convinced they're catfishing you guys with the dorms. For all we know things might get worse and campus gets abandoned again.
<@!252670263848599563>  shoot should i look into apartments again <:meowclown:703735117847330968>
I don't know. I'm sure hoping I can stay on campus in the fall myself
I miss campus.
It was magical :‚Äô)
<:meowclown:703735117847330968>
Campus was great when we weren't in quasi lockdown
Ugh, now I'm getting nostalgic
Campus was wild
But I miss it
I didn‚Äôt interact with people much, but I miss how alive it was
I miss seeing the occasional Sam
Ahah
Trying to hide in that lecture hall
Ahaha yeees I remember that
Sneaky Neuro boi
I took 705 pictures of all the different parts of ucsd
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
And each picture hurt
Nice
I was thinking of touring around with my camera
While it‚Äôs still empty
The nostalgia hurts
Legit you walk around and remember everything before lockdown
A better time
Is campus still open ?
To just walk around
I‚Äôm going to miss the autumn leaves of Revelle and Triton Walk.
<:FeelsBadMan:441463646124507136>
And reminisce ig
We‚Äôll be back
My first year living at Revelle was the most magical year in a long time.
I have to wake up at 8:30AM. Why am I still here?
The sunburn is burning me still and it gets worse at night. I have three spider bites on my feet too and one of them is on my big toe which sucks.
Maybe that‚Äôs what‚Äôs keeping me awake reeee
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
Ouch
I miss just walking
That sounds annoying as hell
I used to sit in Muir and relax
It‚Äôs just itchy and occasionally achey.
I never really talked to anyone, but it was nice
I used to go all the way to 11th floor tioga and chill in the conference room
<@!247048961213333505> It‚Äôs open
I never went to Muir honestly. But there were wonderful moments sitting at Pines looking into the residential area near the utensil area
Same man <@!485663145583575040>
Thanks Sam
Any hidden spots?
There‚Äôs a few behind buildings
The construction covered some sadly
Muir is very compact but has a lot of spaces
I never really explored the campus. I never realised how to live again until recently lmao
I liked it because not many people seemed to use them
I‚Äôm starting to feel super hopeful and like before again somewhat. And I‚Äôm full of energy but can‚Äôt use it
I used to, but then my classes were all centered around PC after my Spring of first year
So I never really explored after that
Just a commute to UCSD
And back
I remember my first quarter was 100% in Center Hall
The days just blur by now
I know that place like the back of my hand
There was a point at the end of this spring where I totally lost track of the day and even week
Lmao
bruh
Same
I was perpetually in week 8
For 2 weeks
Living on campus during spring wasn't easy
It‚Äôs weird to say as a person who hides away naturally
But I really want to just explore outdoors
No one engages in conversation with me :(
So I sit there quietly
Which is fine
It‚Äôs much better to just listen anyway
Walking around campus hurts not because of what once was, but really thinking about what could have been
Until next time
I need to sleep god damn
I‚Äôm going to put on blade runner music and zzz
> No one engages in conversation with me :(
<@186011132325003264> i felt dat doh
Oooo
OG blade runner <@!186011132325003264>
> <@186011132325003264> i felt dat doh
<@!485663145583575040>  Same
I mostly sat alone
Maybe I‚Äôll take my walk around campus this weekend
Duh
As long as I don‚Äôt get ‚Äúend title‚Äù
Cause that is high energy af
Synths all the way
Blade runner blues on the other hand... mmmmmm good shit
Lel
Honestly I need one more rainy day to reset my brain
I love cyberpunk and some of the synth wave genre

Don‚Äôt let anyone say otherwise
2049s soundtrack isn‚Äôt as good, but it has its moments
I wish I could give you a hug
I haven‚Äôt watched yet actually
Planning on rewatch OG sometime tho
2049 is really good
In some ways it hit harder than the original for me
I love me soundtracks.
I went from spamming rocky horror to blade runner and Minecraft music lmao
And then some slow jazz would be good
Luke is right
It does actually hit harder
Mostly just because it‚Äôs ‚Äònewer‚Äô and even more grand
Does it have noodles
God I do like rewatching the original though
The story for whatever reason hit me
I want me noodle scenes
Can't top the tears in rain moment but it gets close
The soundtrack isn‚Äôt as good but it‚Äôs so so
Loud and cinematic
In theatre it was incredible
I really do like the genre though
(Cyberpunk 2077 plz be good)
I love loud movie soundtracks
Interstellar comes to bind
Same actually, I often gravitate to war films (Nolan!)
But yeah interstellar is an epic example
Hmm listening to it the 2049 version of the main theme might be better
Hopefully I‚Äôm not waking up my neighbors
Loud noises or songs makes me overstimulated :(
Awww <:FeelsBadMan:441463646124507136>
Ok Vangelis time

innisfree is expensive but not too much for korean skincare
but for skincare in general ya its more expensive than avg

but also like their prods go a long way
that looks expensive
ok i have the sample size of that and its so fucking hydrating
i use like
around half a dime in size
n thats still a lot
omg innisfree
i've heard good tingz abt it
but i use krave beauty !!!
gr8 for sensitive skin and it's hella fragrance free
i bought the volcanic cluster facial foam + toner and the jeju something dew emulsion
or some shit
i like innisfree bc it works rly well + its really nice on the skin + smells nice
innisfree is typically a safe choice for sensitive skin i think
but idk
amazon sells that for like 21
Tfw ur mom leaves u to cook dinner by urself to look at a new car
and it lasts awhile
But u have no idea wat ur doing
i can confirm, i use it LOL
idrk if it benefits my skin but at least it doesnt hurt it
:keke
if yall know where i can get a non greasy sunscreen hmu
dne
sobs
just burn I guess
Used to be me tbh
i think an lgbtq+ server tht i'm in has a skincare channel but i think i just made tht up bc i dreamed of it once
u ever have a dream where u see sth and u wake up and ur sad bc its not there
but i just... wna... be protected from the sun's deadly lazer rays without feeling like an oiled seal
> u ever have a dream where u see sth and u wake up and ur sad bc its not there
<@!595010202613317632> sometimes i dream of this one person and then i'm relieved tht they're not there when i wake up
i mean theres light weight sunscreens
those should be less greasy
idk abt completely non greasy tho
imagine not embracing skin cancer
oh
i mean what
LMAO ME
ive bought eunscreen but never used it
but iv never been sunburnt so i guess ill wait for cancer
just avoid the sun entirely
bold of everyone to assume that i even go outside
congrats on the onset melanoma @ everyone who lives in cali ig
skin cancer cant get me it krokodil dissolves my skin girst
the sun can catch these hands
ok real question
do u need sunscreen when irs cold
what is melanoma
cuz say its snowy outside
yes
skin cancer cant get me if my other living habits get me first
uv rays and shit
and everything is so bright u cant even see
bc reflection off snow / ice
oh
shit
oh
shit
indeed
if i ever get sunburn ill just nullify it w frostbite
ez
clap
pemdas it cancels out
i just saw the grossest shit on snapchat
this gal was on a whole ass cream colored sofa with her vans on
never mind the color of the sofa but homegirl was
INDOORS
with her
SHOES ON
i have war flashbacks to 2nd yr when vivian and my apt was used as a zoo and everyone who wasn't us wore shoes inside
absolute heathens
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
HEATHENS
i wore shoes in the apt bc i didnt trust ucsd carpet
<:kek:490008924414803968>
YES MAAM!!!!!!! THT SHIT NASTY
which is why u should never be barefoot in a hotel either
especially if there's a white stain on the carpet <:monkaS:442185930867081218>
mmmm bleach!
me 2 shih wen
if one person does it
everyone has to wear shoes
I has 2 aptmates go barefoot while me and the other didn't mind wearing shoes
ucsd carpets nasty af
this is why yall gotta wear slippers indoors
so ppl don't track fucking mud inside the gd
like
they trekked MUD in like WHAT
socks
and on rainy days they still wore their shoes indoors
carpets in general can just hide a lot of nasty shit
yeah socks r valid too but we couldn't wear socks bc if we did tht would mean we would be tracking mud ANd LEAVES aNNND dirt around! yum
not as easy to clean as hardwood or flat surfaces
vivian and me: never wears shoes indoors
also us: has to mop and clean up the mess from ppl wearing shoes inside the house
wack
love sharing a place with a bunch of quy cai ko co giao duc
and ppl who dont wear shower shoes ü§¢ü§¢
^^^^^^^^^
BRUH i cannot think about going barefoot with on campus showers
ik a few ppl who did
n im like *honey thats a bit TOO much trust*
not even a rug doctor will save it
guys
help
theres a bigass spider on the ceiling
my vacuum cleaner doesn't have enough succ
<:shook:606018427018149889>
legit my face when i pushed the vacuum nozzle up to the spider and it didn't get sucked in <:AnimeInsane:615441328720838656>
eat it
get ur protein
jk uhhh have u tried the paper and solo cup method
my ex once called me to remove a crane fly from his room so i tried tht
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
i used to make my roommate
deal w bugs
u put the cup over the critter and then slide the paper underneath
hed jus beat them w his slipper and then wipe it off the wall w clorox wipe
use a clear cup if ur scared of not knowing where the bug is
well its gone now
<@!213151486434082817>  im gonna need u to deal with the bugs next yr
tissue on a yard stick
my trusty friend
spoders r vv cute
still prefer vacuum nozzle
much cuter than crane flies
nina ur so fuckin wrong
bugs are not cute
theyre
terrifying
im scared shitless of bugs
they're so adorable
wait why me?
in case i miss and it starts sprinting down the stick to me
look at a daddy long legs
and tell me
im scared shitless
of lots of things
that that isn't the most harmless looking critter
tht uve ever seen
cuz i dun fuck with bugs
^
üò© daddy üí¶ long ü¶µ  legs
i mean unless u want to get the others to deal with them
outsourcing your job
bottom line is im yeeting out of the room if i see the bug
>:
spindly looking spoders r harmless
like cellar spiders
im scared of maybe having a single nextyear
bc then
i have no one to deal w my bugs
boohoo
jk uwu

Yes
<:angyfeesh:727741286710509568>
AHAHAHAHA WHAT
I WAS CURIOUS
Of course he drank it he didn‚Äôt have a choice but like
Oh no why is richard snapped
It was there
And it looked funky
bruh
he had a choice
the choice was to starve
i would have taken it
It‚Äôs actually not that bad from what I remember
idk why this server is so toxic
> Oh no why is richard snapped
<@!580246928596664321> take a wild guess
wouldnt recommend
At least the steak wasn‚Äôt well done
filing complaint to ucsd to put sanctions on ucsd 22
I‚Äôll take steak pur√©e over well done steak any day
so
is it just me
or do parents
rlly like
well done steak
hmmmmmm
They like rubber bro
my mum is afraid of us getting sick so she prefers medium well steak
U see
Not well done = raw = bacteria lives = bad
^^^
their train of thought
They probably just don‚Äôt have a thick enough cut to know how to do medium rare properly
i disagree
but azn logic
i mean idrk what kind i like
And who tf has a sous vide unless they extra
cuz i had an agreement w my roommate last year that i'd pay for half of meat costs
and he would cook it
for us
<:GWaobloChildPepeSweat:407618812217917451>
For me i prefer medium rare or medium
o dpm
i don't mind well done
but
i really really
love ny
better than
any type
<:bulbaowo:615441070033207307>
richard is lucky we allow him in this server
i prefer uncooked and alive bc im a really big animal fan and i dont like animal cruelty
he's our little exception

surprisingly hs is the most toxic game i've played
idk how
it's single player
Live long enough to become the villain
who can u even be mad at
hearthstone ??
yep
tf2 is easily the most toxic game ive played
been called things i didn't even know about
to the point where someone made a script that pulled chat from league matches bc there was a site for logs to count how many times every player said a no no word
o thats intense
LOL that sounds fun tbh
i spent
5 min
looking through my drive
to see if i have the hs pics
but i can't find it
üò¢
RIP the memories
:(
I have so much HS pics from grad and the day I picked up my diploma
Nothing else lol
i think she meant
hearthstone
LOL
Oh lmao
I just read that text and nothing else lmfao
Ty xd
lolol
LOL

Gotta love being on mobile LOL

i dont hvae any good pics of me
still annoyed
from high school
wat happened to ur tumblr
were u a tumblr pornstar and got deactivated
i rly can't look at it

LMAO
LMAOO

they just will not let me
look at it from the theme
so there's no searching bakc
through it easily
ur telling me ur a cs major but u can't fix ur tumblr theme

why am i just so fucking boring dude
i went into a wormhole
looking at old shit from my google drive
nothing i wrote is shareworthy
not even cringeworthy
just
boring
last week i was reading old ld debate cases from hs ... 2 years ago ... for nostalgia ...

i felt that entirely
what is ld
bro im tryna become a youtuber
lets go
lincoln douglas debate
oooh
u basically just talk at each other really fast
old writing be scary to read sometimes
sounds like big stress tbh
retrospectively im pretty sure every debate kid gave off huge r/iamverysmart vibes
so a rap battle
we werent smart enough to rhyme
thank god the debate kids at my school are chill
they don't rly debate outside of
they're just outgoing
i rlly liked my friends on the debate team in hs n i miss them lots tbh but debate matches were diff
bc ppl rlly do be sweatin
do u ever actually
dislike the people
ur debating after
yea i hate the debate kids from this one local private school
cuz
in debate, there's "companies" that write briefings or whatever, where monthly they'll make like a 80 page doc of researched readings or whatever for u on the current topic
for $
and my team had 0 funding from the school
but priv school teams could afford to buy those
OHHH
i just stole them off other ppl in the debate reddit / debate discord
the folders u get
to look at
for like 10m?
no
o
in ld u go in w pre-written stuff
bc u pre-write responses to questions u think theyll rwite
can u win a debate while stuttering
asking for a friend
i had a stutter and debate made me less nervous while talking
n ppl say my stutter isnt as noticeable anymore
tfw u dont stutter but u ramble
o
i do both
o
lets GOO
and repeat
same
issok it's kinda cute tho
i don't do either but i get lost in thought so fast
esp when i tell ppl shit
annoys tf out of my mans
i'm trying to keep their attention span
u ever jump from one topic to another to another
but i can't even keep mine
one of my friends in junior high did hand motions when he talked and that has lead to me incorporating hand motions in stressful situations <:shmiling:616906674501976096>
yes
but then u realize that u went from like racial dynamics to paint colors in 3 seconds
are hand motions good
have u watched the office episode

WTF god I wish that were me
I'm less than a week into SS1 and I'm already burnt out.
yea
i felt tht
my neuroanatomy class is ass bc the lectures feel absolutely useless, the slides dont rlly have notes??, and idk whats going on
I'm assuming your taking the COGS neuroanatomy class?
I'm not sure how different it is compared to BIPN 160 but I'd be down to help you in that subject.
it's cogs 107a
i rlly appreciate that i will reach out if i need
ty ty
What are you learning right now? :o
uhh we jus started n all of this week's lectures / readings r on neurons and glia
going by textbook this is all thats gna be in the course
so kinda glad bc theres stuff thats been touched on in earlier cogs classes
I miss neuro :((
Get me out of this physics hell
that looks gross
It looks GREAT
neuro makes me depressed
ACTION POTENTIAL
are u in phys 1a
with burgasser
When learning about the brain makes your brain depressed <:cry2:606418962548260894>
if so
Yes
im jus saying
rip
mannn
Please end me
m e t a c o g n i t i o n
That‚Äôs the best part
i had him for 2a
I love me some mandated introspection xd
o for us metacog wasnt ec
tho
it is for u guys right?
Uhhhhh it‚Äôs mandatory
oh oop
i thought it was ec for 1a
but he also switches stuff around a LOT mid quarter
We just have to do exams to gauge our skills and stuff
Bruh
we went from 10 quizzes to 5 to only 2 counting for a grade
like the
weekly exams
PLEASE
so even tho i literally only did well on 2 of them and skipped 2 and bombed 1 kinda and only managed to get above the class avg after the retake
i got an a
There‚Äôs no curve for the class
the hw is literal pure ass tho iirc idk if he made it easier
:(
bc people got so tilted about the hw in his class
that he caved and gave us less hw / less intensive hw
bc the hw averages were in the 70s or something
yea
but is there still the adjusted grade scale
so an a is 87.5
I hope I'm able to handle the class for the summer.
i believe in u
burgasser is lowkey hella hell
the readings are actually
essential
and the problem solving videos
bc while his slides for lecture r p useful just to recap on what u learned this week
I honestly suck at reading and understanding through that. Especially for mathematics.
his lectures r kinda useless
Yeeaahhhh...
it's july
he def has 1a problem solving videos
bc he sent us 1a vids
for 2a
but its hard to follow him
I need a blessing from <@!345083648124649485>
like imo from what ive seen he might be the worst phys prof out of tsai/popmintchev/burgasser
rip u
wait do u guys at least get dropped weekly exams or no?
u got this <@!186011132325003264>
https://oasis.ucsd.edu/academic-services/mstp-folder/index.html#Physics-1A-1C-
btw <@!186011132325003264>
oasis carried me the fuck through phys 2a and 20c/e
and they have 1a ovr the summer

so if u want someone to explain things to u
it might be worth
wait
I actually have no idea how OASIS works lol
it hasnt been updated since spring
idk
bc the 2a tutor is mine from spring

Nice, I kinda want this summer to be over soon ngl
i never
bought
because kcon makes me depressed
i did it for the application perks and didnt even get chosen LMFAOOOo
rip
that's why i never applied <:pepehands:464568955533524992>
or bought
wait did tritoned due already
i thought it died ages ago
<@!186011132325003264> he started out w a kinda strict syllabus w drops, but slowly added more and more so maybe he'll adjust the grade criteria for u guys too
this is for 2a
> wait did tritoned due already
<@!186011132325003264>  it decommissioned starting today
ah
rip ted
i hate your ass
For physics 1a 
Is it algebra based?
i think its like our class without all the calculus
<:widethink:440237377664057353>
bro i just miss the burgasser red glowing eye
emote
Not that 2a has tht much calculus to begin with tho
Lol
i mean we had the
taylor series
thing
ew
taylor series
I mean
It‚Äôs still in that server
and him saying iNteGrAtE for it
ye but i dont rlly have a reason to go into that server bc i dont think ill ever have a class w anyone from that server again
idk
im done w physics for the rest of my life and idk if anyone there is doing ud math
The mcclaurin series is prob the worst thing but too tht bad once u understand wat the problem was asking which i didnt until i saw the answer
tbh i got like a 90 on that hw
and my brain hurt too much
to care about the last 10 points
<:xd:612726759846051861>
the hw / quiz avg's in that class
were always a yikes
idk how the class avg gpa was so high
prolly drops
<:xd:612726759846051861>
I mean
The cutoff for a is 85 and above
oh ur right
5% ec too
i was aiming for a 82.5% starting the first day of class LMAO
Like wat would usually be considered an avg b is now an a
I have archived the entirety of BIPN 100
From TritonED <:triga2:614108256813711380>
<:xd:612726759846051861>
how do u pronounce
bipn
like u know how u say bild like build
and cogs like ... cogs
do u say bippin
Bee Eye Pee Een
I downloaded everything on chem6a and math18 from tritoned
You can say Bippin too...
Should I archive PSYC 100 aaaa
idk if ill ever look @ anything on ted
tbh
Not tht it will be of any use anytime soon
It‚Äôs funny how those two are the only classes where i got c‚Äôs
<:xd:612726759846051861>
im entirely sure i got like a 40% on my 6a final
but i got a b- in the class
chem is fucked idk how people do that
<:xd:612726759846051861>
U can say the same to physics
every class is hard im gonna
become
a
idk
fuck
<:xd:612726759846051861>
Richard.exe has stopped working
I have yeeted the entirety of PSYC 100 too
The archives must not be incomplete <:shook:606018427018149889>
<:shook:606018427018149889>
the <:yeet:442868651792793601>  is real
ok me must bed bed
8am class
chem is disgusting
fuck chem but fuck physicks harder
the 2 series can eat my entire culo
sio buffed my gpa hella <:yeet:442868651792793601>
and cogs 1 was a mistake
cogs 1 was ez
i was confused af <:pain:713285895419330591>
sio helped my gpa to lol
too*
sio 35 water xd
COGS 1 is dumb
And the professors agree
lmao driscoll just yeets A+s to everyone
cogs 1 made me feel dumb my first quarter lol
You take it with Boyle?
FA18?
yessssss
all i learned was how bad my sleep patterns were <:kek:490008924414803968>
<a:ohohoho:636686946734964786>
Ok same class me then
I gamed the exams in that class so hard
Thanks to my polish TA
Absolute lad
lol nice
i just got average
sux that my exam 2 grade dropped
Boyle is a good professor, but was harsh with some of the quizzes
yo the quizzes hurt ngl
Still the hardest quizzes i've done at UCSD
Lol
Including CSE
saaame
cogs 1 and poli 13d are the banes of my existence
even econ 100a is more acceptable
I haven't hit anything yet thats made me hate life
But I have Gary Gillespie in CSE in Fall
So
Theres time
prepare to kys

A man who is already condescending in 12 or 15
how to instantly make someone want to drop out of a major
Teaching entry level CSE
<:pepeLMAO:490384254534942720>
Apparently he named and shamed a students exam
So usually Gary
<:gary:433451558676594688>
reason #2537 of why i decided not to become a software engineer: CS
Reason I didn't choose CSE at UCSD reason number
2
Out of at least 15
Reason number 1 being I don't like the theoretical nature of the program
*the remaining reasons being that I had no chance of getting in anyway*

Should I drop my summer classes aaaaaaaaaaaaaa
I need 4AM guidance
<:cry2:606418962548260894>
no
in what sense
ur the one asking for guidance at 4am
u figure it out
Bruh
goodnight
What a rude person :/
well then
<@186011132325003264> what's got u hung up abt it mluv
i think u still have time to make a decision (until the 7th, bc if u wait longer ull get charged for the class)
if ur only taking tht one class im p sure u can power thru it!
I‚Äôm taking the lab too and honestly it‚Äôs a lot of work
I don‚Äôt have a lot of background and maths ain‚Äôt great
Plus what kind of professor expects 3 weekly quizzes and worksheets, and a weekly exam on top of that aaaaa
actual ass
is this 107a? bippy mnetioned tht he had a midterm and quizzes each week for it
^  think he means physics w burgasser bc thats how it was when i took him
kinda brutal class tbh
Lowkey physics during speedy online summer session does nooooot sound like the move
That sounds scary af
Physics in general too scary
^
and thats why im cs c:
also gm gamers i hate waking up before 9:30
Same and same
Gotta love 9am meetings üò°
<:pepehands:464568955533524992>
i have 8am class
F
breaks during ss classes r fake
LMAOOO
u just stare at ur screen for 10 mins
thats rough yea
like where tf am i gonna go huh
last summer i got like 15 min breaks and i'd just sit outside when the weather was nice
cuz mandeville basement be cold
that sounds really nice
but also yea idk lie in bed
no thats for after class im going back to sleep smfh
hows ur internship
bro just lie in bed whenever u can :^)
day1 we had 20-30 min breaks throughout the day and jeff napped in every single one
stonks
and my internship is goin aight
except my team not that helpful when i need opinions/comments xD
Supercomputing center right?
yesh c:
rip
Woah a lot of people are in that huh
u r ur team
Also that's a rip
how do u get in that it sounds rlly cool tbh
Are you making a new proj or working on some existing one?
its been fun and im learning quite a bit but its rough doin it on my own and makin these decisions based on my very minimal experience
thats a rip
its a new proj!
um as to how we got in
Ooo that's cool
but ur gna learn hella bc ur doing it on ur own so
bigger brain
its a new program, made for the remote setting of this summer
ahhh i see
and there was an application
henry posted it like a month ago in <#661466804996276224> i think
smh right when i wasnt in the server
> but ur gna learn hella bc ur doing it on ur own so
yea this b the goal
LMAO O FUCK
TRU
LMAOO
F
is ok i have summer session to die over
gl w ur internship tho
ur gna do great
just
eat ur team members
and the vitamins of their brain
will carry u
Wait how long are ss classes?
ez
uhh
Big brain
3 hrs each
5 weeks
Jeezus
actual class format depends
i only have class m/w
Oh so 1:30 classes
huh
no
3 hours
Oh
O H
yea i think mine was like that too

either MWF 3 hrs or MW 3 hrs
i just took psyc6 tho so
so like this is my schedule
its whatever
i dropped cogs 100 tho
*panik*
thankfully i dont actually have time conflict
since the other class is prerecorded
thats an oof
but that class sucks on its own

ss2 is a fat
xd
8ams every day
xdddd
Riiiip
Also cse 20 riiiiiiiip
i think itll b a cool class
maybe
idk
I mean it's interesting
8am might be good bc i force myself to go to 8ams and skip later classes
But the 2nd half is literally just a proofs class
well at least the second half will be like 2 and a half weeks
for me
oh luke are you in cse20 too?
i send u my stuffs!
oh wait
nvm thats richard taking it
SEND IT STEPH

You are older than me this you must teach me mentor  <@!303002872646467596>
Then 151b is deep learnin
ok im gonna actually

I realiZed i have wayyy to many games in my backlog so
i cant afford valorant
:((
Yes it costed me too much of my sanity
steph be my mentor
Petition to give steph mentor role?
andrew ur my math 180a mentor
steph is my cse everything mentor
sTOP nO
luke idk what u r but ur mentoring me in something
not like this
Haha very funny richard!
i would want stoof to be my mentor but i would prob bring her IQ down with me
i have all my old resources but dont trust me
Bruh your resources saved me in 183
when the insta like button is unnecessarily close to where ur thumb is when u scroll<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
honestly tho^
aw luke im glad to hear that!! c:
is it too close to ur thumb or is ur thhumb too close to it <:scrunchthink:440232169919610880>
<:pepehands:464568955533524992>
i be liking dumb shit on accident
steph also saved me in math183
<:kirblush:613942747224604702>
<:bulbaowo:615441070033207307>
Gdi i need sleep
I went to heat up milk in the microwave and instead of putting a time, i out my phones pin number
<:FeelsBadMan:441463646124507136>
o h
it really be like that sometimes..
so your milk was warm?
damn that's rough though
warm that shit for like 50 min
I got plum juice on my favorite shirt <:pepehands:464568955533524992>
nah i realized my mistake before i started then just stood there in defeat
but it was for my coffee so we chillin
:0
i prefer half n half for brewed cofveve
i've recently learned to drink my coffee black for keto reasons
ur doing keto randy?
yeah for a month or so
oh thats cool
or im going to do it for a month
i "started" last week
everyday salad and dressing
you have to be careful about what youre eating in your salad lol
no tomatos or carrots
o rly
didn't know that
yeah a lot of veggies have sugar/carbs in them
so keto is high fat high protein diet, so i've been eating a lot of meat
its something to do with ketosis right
yup yup
where your body starts using fat as fuel instead of carbs
ahh ok
bang on
i was thinking of trying out
i've broke a couple times last week, but that was cause i went out with friends a couple times
maybe after i start living alone
my family must consume rice
its easier cause half my family is doing it
but yeah when living alone trying out diets tend to be esier
> warm that shit for like 50 min
<@!303002872646467596> wait i actually have a story from high school about this
my chinese teacher instead of setting the microwave to 1 min, she sets it to one hour
half an hour later we hear fire alarms, but our schools has a ton of false alarms so we ignore them
little later smell something weird
*turns to the closet*
there fucking smoke
so we go outside, but we're giving presentations
omfG
so i have to give a chinese presentation outside by holding my laptop up at max brightness
LMFAO
F
and trying to speak chinese even tho idgaf cuz its senior year
REEEEEEEEEEE
my tagalog is so bad ngl
sometimes im fluent af
other times im just trash
at least you can speak it sometimes
i can't speak my parent's lang
~~only know the words when they're bout to whoop my ass~~
~~ey thats the important part right~~
<:yeet:442868651792793601>
When my parents use my full name. Ik they about to whoop my ass ü•¥
My broken Persian still gets by. Just not at my grandparents ü§≠
now ik tht american + persian culture use full names when someone's in trouble
tbh my parents have never used my full name on me they just go "NA toi day ba/me bieu"
which means "cmere i need to talk to you" which is probably one of the scariest things to hear imo
wait yall getting warnings before being beat?
yeah first is the lecture and then the corporeal punishment
gotta love fucked up child abuse masked as tough love
Although I hated my parents for doing that to me, I knew where they were coming from and they've learned from it as they apologize for it now and seem to be doing well at keeping their emotions in check and not lashing out with that. But I also don't think violence should be a way to teach children no matter how "good" of a method it may be
^^^
you learn to explain their actions but not excuse them
Yeah thats exactly it
like yeah forgiving them does shit for the trauma tht's already settled in you but it gives a little bit of peace of mind. but i understand if ppl still resent their parents for doing tht, and i'd never blame them for still being spiteful or hurt
I've loved my parents to death since I can remember, but yeah I can't excuse them for how they acted back then but as I grew up and heard stories and talked with my grandparents I realized the situation they were put in, young parents, no knowledge, new country, there really wasn't any way they could've known what to do, so I give them props for learning from their mistakes. I don't like how they did it but that doesn't mean I resent or hate my parents now.
idk if thatt made sense, so sorry if it didn't
It makes my blood boil
Nah that makes sense well said, my parents do the same. They aren't as bad as before now that my brother has a job and i go to college, but they still continue on with the lectures and not really knowing how to communicate their thoughts/emotions except through the long talks and angryness. I just had a lecture yesterday and it was kinda sad, but i believe slowly they will change or hopefully change, but yes I still love my parents for the things theyve taught me

Good morning UCB
Gm gaymers

<:hypers:471374617337135134>
<:bulbaowo:615441070033207307>
wait
should i go for a minor in COGS <:kek:490008924414803968>
<@!181482518107783168> are there any interesting neuro UD classes for cogs that has little to do with nasty coding or data science
wdym nasty coding
all coding is nasty
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
<@!186011132325003264> What kind of focus
Cogs has a lot more neuro than beep boops
A lot of them are developmental or animal congition
its a minor so i dont get a focus officially
i have a cogs minor and ive only found like 4 beep boop cogs classes <:FeelsBadMan:441463646124507136>
The human cognition classes are basically 100% data science courses at this point
its just cogs sci
But thats why some need 118

118A-C and 108 are beep boop classes
107a is neuro
i am take rn
it is very intense
theres psyc equivs
I'm thinking of taking 11, 17, 107 series
but idk what else
118A-C isn't beep boop
Its just Maths
just do the 107 series
Isnt 118 computer vision
no maths pls :C
<@!186011132325003264>
trust me
o
its neuro
The CSE version of the course is the applied version
118 is ai/ml
i think
o makes more sense
I'm asking about the 2 additional UD classes :o
Cogs version is purely theory
KEK im not doing 118 bc prereqs
A lot more maths heavy and harder
Then the CSE one
gimme 1 sec and ill find it for u <@!186011132325003264>
i do like me some maths tho
ty <3
107 series is a good entry
But its fairly basic
Like PSYC 106 and 108

these are the
specialization elections
for cogs spec neuro
so i figure u might be interested in these
elections
i meant
electives
wait thats smart
thank you
yesir
yessir
if i try for a cogs minor
if u can do ur other ud's in those listed
its 7 classes which is JUST enough so that I have to take 4 classes for the rest of my time at ucsd
101a is sensation / perception and 101b is learning, memory, attention
101a was easy for me

if u do well in cogs17 neurobio in cognition, which i assume u will since ur a neuro major, 101 and 107 series should be chill
c o g s
c o g s
cogchamp
oh god i cant believe im considering this
become a cogs major
u wont
but if i dont do cogs im stuck with
1-2 classes max
for senior year LMAO
in a quarter*
bruh i wont
im too far in already
im trying to switch major
third year
but idk if ill be able to xd
I believe
what are you switching to
trying for cs
idk if ill pull it off
i mean realistically even if i do all the cs screening classes, i can jus get a cs minor and my grad wouldnt be delayed

<:zoom:477403211473354753>
gl gl
inb4 i dont get accepted into cogs minor
idk how the class is organized, but for prof. johnson as long as u memorized the vocab u were 90% of the way there
nahhh no way u dont
LMAO i just got an email about deadlines for adding/dropping summer classes
july 28
i might have to
uh
take a W
in cogs 107a
LMAO
idk whats going on ...
no one knows whats going on...
july 6th for full refund
https://discord.gg/jEb3bQ

oh god
if u want to join cogs discord
for when u take cogs classes
v helpful imo esp. for collab study guides
since open note tests during uc zoom
when cogs kiddos see a neurobio major walk in <:yeet:442868651792793601>
lmaooo
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
I didn't know this existed
i joined it last qtr
I've been hiding alone this whole ass time
Lel

this qtr
so u can be my partner
<a:PEPESCREAM:659115134089822288>
idk anyone in that class rn
Haven't done 108
u dont need 108
<:thonk:440231969796784128>
only cse 11 and math 18
Really
Neat
and cogs 14b
yea
tbh u need a very basic understanding of stats
and python
so far
well
cse 11 / mae 8 / cogs 18
or cse 8a
mae 8 <:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
<:pepehmm:520539005477978123>
Maybe I'll do it

No I yeeted out
<@!595010202613317632>
I'm doing a GE
fake
smh
I'm in Bach right now for Math 18
smart decision
i need a partner
Its kinda easy
math18 is def the easiest lower div math
imho
But I think its mostly because bach is going hella slow
20d>>>>>
I'd say we get through maybe 80% of what we want in this SS
is 20d worth taking
just for fun
Bach says he is moving fast <:huh:442185049870434307>
sam
just think of it this way
when i took it with kitsela
the first midterm
was on chapter 1
by week 3
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
Thats gonna be similar
Only end of Week 2

here is meme
Into week 3
At this rate
and then he covered the entire last 2 chapters in a week rlly fast, then had 10 hours of review lectures week 10
still think kitsela is the best math prof ive had
bach is death
im dumb
how is he <@!181482518107783168>
so idk anything
<:FeelsBadMan:441463646124507136>
Bach is good for CS
And not bad for this
20 series is a big no thanks
With Bach
When is COGS 107A usually offered..
<:headscratch:593920753024630785>
Fall, Winter
Summer
Sometimes all three quarters it seems
That'll be the hardest thing for me since it's offered at weird times.
And it seems my winter for 22 might be filled entirely
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
After FA20 I'll be riding 3 class a quarter until I finish
I guess I could graduate in WI of my final year
But meh
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
This lecture is dead
No way we finish chapter 1 this week
If I didn't drop physics
I would be seeing
1 class for fall quarter

OK KEEP EM COMING IM TRYING TO GAUGE A MEAN FOR THIS
And they‚Äôre all in California because oos is too much money <:pepehands:464568955533524992>

Money
^
They spent

O wait actually I applied to 8
why
whyst
o das valid henry, me 2
apparently they didn't spend a lot
but who tf
has tht amt of time
I wanna know how many this person in
Tbh maybe I should‚Äôve applied to a couple more besides UCs xd
ehhh
college apps be exp
I didnt apply to that many because waivers
i knew i wasn't gna go to private ones so i didn't apply
My dumbass paid for CSU‚Äôs and I didn‚Äôt know there were waivers widjjebe
so i just used waivers on ucs and csus
Idk why I bothered with privates, I knew I wasn‚Äôt gonna be able to afford LOL
Same
I only got into 1 private and it was usd
i applied to 18 <@!286708165612011531>
and got into 1
wassup
my condolences
but
my dream school gave me a waiver
then rejected me
..
at least it was ucsd !!!!!
i couldve been going to a liberal arts college in massachusetts
i couldve been whitewashed
i couldve been one of those "as a poc, racism doesn't exist üíØ " kids
the chances of me never knowing richard.... <:shiba:606991297022001199>
> i couldve been one of those "as a poc, racism doesn't exist üíØ " kids
<@595010202613317632> can't w8 to debate one of these fkers in phil 27
my bestie had to deal with one of those ppl in her hds class who said tht azns don't experience racism
bc they're the most privileged poc
i could've been calling my friends "buddies" instead of "homies"
me: bih ur thinking abt e azns
i stg non azn ppl hear azn and they think omg they're all chinese
or korean
or japanese
i would argue tht my experience in buffalo (60% black 40% white i think?) is that while microaggressions exist primarily from white people
systemic racism isnt as prevalent against east asians
south azns and se azns:
but that doesnt mean it doesnt exist at all
bc if anything covid showed how quick white ppl were willing to flip on "model minority" and call chinese ppl "bat soup" or whatever
no matter how whitewashed
idk pop off in phil 27 lmk how it goes
we're not supposed to flame anyone so ):
change ur name in zoom to prometheus and tell them the flame is for their own good
but i will stay strapped jic a non poc or non azn decides to lecture me abt my own heritage/ethnicity
wauw clever
my decal got approved :0

they're so nice
nighttime revelle is a soothing feel
erc gives the best vibes out of reshall and apartments
nighttime warren gives me wong fu drama vibes

No, like plant science
science of plants

*successful
yea my sister
doesnt have emotion
either
its kinda crazy
my sister only knows one emotion
angor
o
i dont have
<a:pepehell:717609408057573466>
a sister
im an only child
its ASS
i used to say "YoU WisH You DiDn't Have  A SiBLIng" but there's pros n cons to both
get a cat so i can cuddle it while im drunk
the cat tells you to not have emotions
a simp check
im more of a cricket type of guy
but thats just me
used to want a sister and although i would be happy to have one i wouldn't trade kavin for anyone else
the kiddo's precious
a brat
but precious
my sister's interesting
inch resting bc she's smol
jk she's getting taller now it do be kinda scary
me: ur so kind. how r u so kind for a near 12 yr old, i was a wack tween
i-
OH MY GODD THE HEIGHT
IT RLLY FUCKS U UP
like
me: why tf do u get so aggravated at the fact i did this when i don't get mad at u for that
i came back after winter quarter finals
dude i want a sibling so fucking badly bro like
my sister is literally a ball of anger and i am the opposite
someone to talk to at home ??? so im not just at my computer all the time ???
tru
a constant HOMIE OBLIGATED to support u ???
and i hadn't been home since tet
someone to scapegoat and hate when u need it ???
BET !!!
omg
so when i came back and saw tht kavin shot up to my chin i str8 up started weeping
yeah tru
awawawawawwwawaw
like he grew 3 whole inches
wait
when do people stop growing
is it
18
or 25
i think my sister would miss me but she doesn't show emotion so i would never know lMAO
or something like that
uhh for guys it's like 22
LETS GOOO
im tryna be 6'2
gorls is like 18 i think
WTFFF
for girls it's ^^
yuh 18
UNFAIR
> im tryna be 6'2
<@!595010202613317632> gimme some of ur inches pls
6'1 just sounds like im actually 6'0 and insecure
no
give me URS
im trying to get taller
so are u 6 foot and insecure
absolutely NOT
NO !!!!!
no 6'0 is the insecurity
cause thats when youre really 5'11
6 foot is 5'11 rounded up <:DogKek:694453922768879646>
6'1 is 6'0 and insecure because 5'11 kids say they're 6'0 because they're insecure
so is 5'9
so 6'0 kids have to differentiate
my math checks out
im definitely > 6'0 but im not sure what my actual height is bc people say my hair makes me taller
LMAo
u give off tiny energy
my hair flat asf
he does
...
angry tiny energy
sometimes i think ab how easy life would be if i was just
5'9
but is actually a giant
yea giant
brain
haha
like when i first saw a pic of richard i was like *snaps* 5'8
üß†
sometimes i think ab how easy life would be if i was just **__5'6__**

almost everyone is a liberal arts major
by definition
its like p much just non engineering
if i switch into cs
ill be sure
to select the BA
and not BS
LOOL
I wonder if there are any cs majors getting the ba degree
Because everyone I know is bs
bullshit
i'll switch right now, bet
Bet
Bet?
i think it defaults to BS
idk anyone who's BA
theres also not a huge difference in requirements
Wait, I thought they canned the BA
It wasn't offered as an option for me
yalldvest
why are spotify music ads actually decent
like when they play the song and go "tHis is [so and so] on spotify and tHis iS mY nEw soNg"
hm idk
but I feel like on plans.ucsd.edu like the planning website they have cs28 as an option
which is the BA
and cs28 is written in the catalog for most upper div cse classes I think?
also viv that is incorrect bc back in hs when I didnt have spoot premium I'd get horror movie ads
I hate em
thats why i didnt say spotify ads
only the music ads xd
CS28 is gone I think
ok true, viv
There is only CS26
> also viv that is incorrect bc back in hs when I didnt have spoot premium I'd get horror movie ads
<@!303002872646467596>  SAMEEE WTF

ooohh

wait viruses
shit bro i hate viruses and bacteria
LMAO
<a:pepehell:717609408057573466> <a:pepehell:717609408057573466> <a:pepehell:717609408057573466>
but bacteria is help
we never finished our immunology unit in ap bio
cuz corona :((
issok i still try to help uwu
bio is like the one class i wish didnt get cut
one of two classes i actually liked last year
calc and bio were fun <:hypers:471374617337135134>
bio is interesting but was hard for me
yeah same
but my teacher was really good
virus is no brain all blob want to infect thing with brain so it can have many baby
and his class was 11/10
Am I the only one here
That avoids bio like a plague
bacteria is bad thing with brain that want to take other thing away so it can live there
i only recently started considering bio related major
idk tho
owo
im still undecided
crispr <:okjim:694657767230931055>
and apps coming up v soon <:GWvertiPeepoChrist:405951687480705024>
just do both bio and cs
Double major
i dont really wanna do cs
crispr is overrated when u can talk about car t cell therapy BABYYYYYY
but dad wants me too
ah
Do fake cs
well
god i‚Äôve unleashed the bio jasper
Like cog sci
LOL
ive had a pretty bad experience with cs
but i did a sumemr program for it
and did apcs
and im now in a cs class
viv u should do physics
tbh bio me only came out like spring quarter
jk dont
and its fine
i dont enjoy it that much but its ok
LMAO
*Physucks*
i low key was gonna switch out of bio major cause i was so bored learning about organic chemistry and basic bio
i had bad experience with physics too
i hate physics period
bad teachers and classes
chem is fun !!!
i really liked chem
the thing is
if u major in physics i have mad respect for u for being able to love something that is so painful
lmao watch me switch into marine bio no one be surprised
i didnt like cs and phys cuz bad teacher
bold of u to assume i love it jasper
Wait phys was fun in hs
so what if i only like bio and chem because i had good teachers
so im kinda doubting myself xd
damn whats a word thats stronger than love
its not like ur forced into 1 major in college
u can always explore
I think it entirely depends on how you engage with it outside of class
well yes but actually sorta
ok if ur premed u can technically major in anything.... right......
ok but like
my application is strongest for cs
cause I definitely would like to learn about bio
premed is major in anything as long as u have the required classes needed for med school
premed is different u actually have to be masochistic for that
because i did a summer program for it
but also premed is premed
But I never take it for clases
premed seems ok
im considering biomed eng
> but also premed is premed
<@!143214977585643520>  sir wtm
ik a friend who took premed and her social life died
major in
nothing on my app was cs-related
wichawd
BC LITERALLY I WILL GO INTO THE MARINE BIOLOGY MAJOR NO JOKE

LMAO
if it makes u feel better i got accepted into physics having never gotten an A in a physics class

I always looked up to this guy because he was the OG reviewer
He worked at Blizz originally
A lot of the slightly later real real reviewers like Angry Joe came from this dude
Not that many people probably know Joe these days
Damn.. that‚Äôs a lot to take in. I‚Äôm sorry

mood
oof
i got a net 2 pips yesterday
so thriv?
my friend ranked up on the win
ooh nice
ranked do be that
but no deranks on the lost
so we good
ayy
and randos are
bruh it was so sad
so fucking useless actually
someone posted a pic of their comp lobby
really hit or miss
and we were like omg sabien promoed to gold 1!!!
and it was just a visual bug
<:peepocry:640363747990306827>
D:
RIP
thats actually so scam : (
fr
bruh the other day i was playing
and our rando
would not stop stomping
stomping?
and he wasnt even aiming at toes
he was aiming at the floor in front of them
so he never dealt damage
oh yikes
F
literal 9 econ score
yikes
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
hate to see it
stomping -> running everywhere
fr
<:xd:612726759846051861>
oh yeah and another friend got a 2v5 i ncomp pepehands
like 4 rounds in it was 4v5
then another 5 rounds 3v5
it was like 12-4 when the third left
and they lost 5 rounds before he managed to clutch an ace
yikes
he prob wouldve promoed if they won 13-4 :(
but he promoed the game after so its ok <:xd:612726759846051861>
yeah i either duo with my friend or 5 stack for ranked usually. my friend is alright but he hypes me up so thats all that matters <:kek:490008924414803968>
ayyy lmao
i always 5 stack cuz im scared of randos
yes
we're not very good tho
be very afraid of randos
im also scared of people being toxic cuz grill xd
we had a good rando  in that win i was telling you about
ah yeah
love that
i just
only do callouts
yeah but even then <:GWvertiPeepoChrist:405951687480705024>
and when people are being toxic/shitters, i just mute them
üôÇ
i dont like talking unless im top fragging or no randos are above me
im usually playing better than them anyway so doesnt matter
cuz then they cant flame me
mhm
cant relate (:
F
just keep playing üòâ
tbf i think its because the people i play with are better than me
which means the elo is oof
mhm
this however doesnt apply to ranked
so im just bad
i drag all my gold friends to plat, which isnt much different tbh
LMAO
one of my friends found out i was playing comp with some others
and he was like
but then when i actually play with like Ed and stuff, i have to really try bc it gets to plat/diamond/immortal lvl
yo get me in on this
but hes plat
and we're bad

question
what is the key
to
stop command prompt
so it stops doing this
Idk wtf that is but ctrl+c returns back to the command line or whatever and ctrl+d terminates program
I‚Äôm also not a very good CS Major so I could be completely wrong so gl üôÇ
thank
i half expected a "just alt f4"
Nah, did that work tho?
The ctrl c or d*
idk because i really did alt f4

gimme a sec
Works ig
omg thank godi  decided to go back to the file
i forgot to finish my header

her, patiently waiting for me to google translate colonization:
i had to check her on her internalized racism and colorism but it didn't seem like she was very receptive so i had to explain tht her being "weirded out" by me being with a darker skinned person is not ok
but hey at least we didn't yell at each other this time : D

but im scared mom
Yeah, solo q is scary üò¢
Idk that‚Äôs why I still play with my friends even if we‚Äôre not the same rank, it‚Äôs just more fun to play with them
Maybe I‚Äôll try a solo q tomorrow
yeah its def more fun
also im like
theoretically
when i play with my comp stack
which is different than my crazily skewed unrated stack
it hsould be around my elo
cuz im s3 and we have a g1 a g2 a s2 and a s1
so im literally in the middle
solo q is hell
I am so tired
8 hours today and for 10 more days
80 hours to rank up 2 elos

bruh
im
the idea was from my least fave decathlon member who gave me hell for the 2 yrs he was on the team
AND HE'S ONE OF THE MODS FOR THIS SHIT
maybe i just d word
it's called
acadec league
i hate it here.
I too hate it here
me: am i interested in this bc i want to compete again + learn abt another overarching topic or am i just tryna relive my ocad glory days
oo they wna incorporate aesthetics into the literature subject
THEY'RE REBRANDING ECON AS FINANCE
isnt aesthetics
philosophy
AND ADDING A NEW TOPIC WHICH IS CURRENT EVENTS
yes

wtf they actually want to host this shit
in arizona and texas
idk how they'll actually combine aes and lit so im gna ask abt tht
me: yall rlly gna not include cali as a host state even though all of usad national champions in the past 22 yrs
have been from cali
omg they're reverting back to the og way ppl r gna study for the topic which is independent research
could be a yikes bc there's gna be so much info tht won't be standardized //////:
THE TOPIC FOR NEXT YR IS THE ACADEMY AWARDS SJJWJSKWJDJSJSJ
are phil classes mostly like . convos in class
like how does it work
it seems rlly interesting but
or is it a Lot Of Writing
mmmm
so
phil 27 is lecture heavy but the instructor regularly asks for input and comments from us
+ discussion i assume would have a lots of talking but i have an asynchronous disc time for phil27 bc my ta is currently in singapore and he can't have a live class
ah
bc phil sounds interesting
essays r a huge chunk of ur grade too
so yeah writing heavy
honestly phil is a class thats teaching me to say things with my chest
uh oh
also usad league is actually usad 2.0 but shittier so
i like to write but idt its good enough to carry my grade xD
not participating
hmmm i wouldn't say tht if ur "not a good writer" tht u won't "get a good grade"
like
phil 27 is abt stating wht u will argue abt and backing it up
our prof makes it so that if your writing improves over time your grade can change for the better
mostly about making sure you can gives reasons to your arguments
it doesn't have to be a whole sophisticated academic paper tht's hard to read for u to get a good grade
like dino said the class is p helpful in helping u say wht u need to directly without beating around the bush + using strong evidence to prove ur points
idt ppl r necessarily bad writers in general, u just have to understand how to structure an argument or paper so it's easy to follow, has flow, and has relevant info/evidence
i digress tho, but yeah phil is heavily discussion and writing based
oh wauwww
oh yeah Sorry what i meant was
im not good at argumentative papers xD like it is simple in theory but my mind does not wrap around it
mood
i have been trained to write rhetorical analyses <:hyperJ:694448211439648809>
also or creative writing but thats it
anything else and my brain fizzles
tht's where ur instructor comes in and helps u orient urself to write more argumentative papers
also wht's helped me is instead of trying to figure out how my writing sucks by myself, i reach out and ask in wht ways can i improve my paper from the instructor themselves
had to get over tht fear in order to improve my writing
bruh the moment he said that we could use first person in our papers
WHAT
i think my mind exploded
FIRST PERSON
<a:ohohoho:636686946734964786>  the power i hold in first person is immaculate
> also wht's helped me is instead of trying to figure out how my writing sucks by myself, i reach out and ask in wht ways can i improve my paper from the instructor themselves
<@!286708165612011531> tru i do that too
but i have trust issues in that realm LMFAOOOO
honestly tho can i imagine
"IN THIS ESSAY I WILL"
"i think that CALLARD'S ARGUMENT WAS GOOSE SHIT!"
i brought my paper to my ap lang teacher once he said it was fine, "pretty good for a rough draft!" and was proud of me
second time around on my Final Draft
"you should've fixed this this and this. why did you keep this in?"
<:PEPESCREAM:466446495747670027>
me: <:pain:713285895419330591>
tf
like i literally doNT TRUST MY ENGLISHH TEEEACCCCHHHEEEERRRRSSS
hs english teachers are either neutral evil or chaotic good
oh fun fact nina
it was about ||astrology||
MY TEACHER WAS DEF NEUTRAL EVIL
god the exact embodiment
i really enjoyed phil 27 sdjfhs
me seeing one of the topics in the syllabus being yellow fever: üëÅÔ∏èüëÑüëÅÔ∏è
god i wish tht were this summer sesh
you would've popped off
me, trying to worm it somewhere into my final essay
https://tenor.com/view/kermit-typing-frog-fast-comments-gif-5275838
we ARE gna talk abt cultural appropriation tho
so
HA
im read
y
LGIIIII
<:shiba:606991297022001199> i don't wna be tht person but i can't say tht bc i'd be lying
but i AM gna be THT person in class
its ok i was That Person in my discussion i'm p sure
sitting-in-the-front-of-the-class lookin-ass
uh oh yall im scared
||my other acc just called out TKAM in a post LOLLLL people are gonna screech its fine||
oop
üçµ
eh
let em screech
AHAHHA
ok bet
ppl get angry bc sometimes wht they've believed for a long time gets upended and then they're indirectly called out for participating in sth tht's wrong/unacceptable
bc the defensiveness then morphs into angor ü§©
tru
and tbh we arent even calling it a bad book
we explicitly said it is still a great book
but it shouldnt be the only book in curriculum that is used to teach us abt race
it's like hp; a v influential book series but still extremely flawed
deadass
tru!
also it was written by a white woman
isnt rowling like
so even when we're learning abt racism
against trans......
it's thru the white lens
yeah she's a terf
<:kirbygun:613942917135990803>
YES exactly like TKAM bc its written in a White savior complex narrative
rowling <:PEPESCREAM:466446495747670027>
daniel radcliffe rlly went
i mean yeah i was harry potter
but fuck rowling
LOLLLL
> [7:13 PM] Yen | Biosystems | WarrenüòÇüÉè: hs english teachers are either neutral evil or chaotic good
   so tru lmao
mine were so chaotic good
i wish mine were chaotic good <:peepocry:640363747990306827>
what makes a neutral evil english teacher
hmmm
time to describe my teacher
lives in their classroom
uhhhh
takes a 3 months to grade a one page paper
uhhhh
yeah i dont remember anymore but i had him for two years and he is just a neutral evil LMAOOO
he's evil when he wants to be ig
the worst english teacher i had in hs had everybody in her class drop/get transferred
everybody else in the same class had like 30 kids with two sections
but she only had one section with less than 15 kids
i tried to transfer out but the counselor literally said "sorry but it's your turn with her"
still wouldn't say she's neutral evil
maybe like
chaotic neutral
OOOf
thats the ib eng teacher at my school LOLOL
unlucky
is there a chaotic evil
ye
bc thats the other ap lang teacher at my school xD
yea the class was ibsl english
LOLOL
imagine having ib
she ended up getting transferred to a different school in the district after my year
passing around like a hot potato
oof
ib hl english was the best decision i made ever
ngl
i didnt have the option for sl english
what makes you say that
i loved both of my ib lit teachers
i had ib hl english/ap lit rolled into the same class my senior year
i didn't really like my hs english teachers
like the content was so so worth
idk
i got 5 on exam and i didnt rlly know what i was doing
but my favorite class was by far ib hl philosophy
We talking cheney ir
but the teachers were very individualistic
yea <@!345083648124649485>
Disgusting
Thank god i never had her
and i learned a lot ab bullshitting writing
but having fun with it
so worth
i did ap lit+comp or w.e it was called in grade 10 then ib hl for 2 years
i don't remember the ib hl english test
was that a thing
yes
u had to choose btwn poetry and prose
i think
yea i remember now
yea i dunno don't think i ever learned any writing in my english classes
it was just
we didnt do any like
reading
tbh
here's the rulebook of stuff you gotta mention
senior year
cuz senioritis we gave up
we just watched a lot of shakespeare plays, waiting for godot, and talked ab life w our teacher
idk
wow ib humanities with no reading?
no way
jr year
we read a lot
i guess our ib structure was just weird
everyone started skipping class
senior year
so theres no point
like my school avg's 2/7 on ib physics hl
cause we didn't have two year ib hl it was just ib sl as a prereq for ibhl
cuz no one goes to class sr year
oh wtf
we have 2 year hl's
like for hota hl, i did apush for first year then second year of just hota hl
our ibhl hota was just one year they didn't even bother with trying to offer ibsl hota
thats crazy
i didnt learn anything in hota hl
did ya take hl physics
my ia was like "sooo the cia in central america huh üëÅÔ∏è üëÉ üëÅÔ∏è "
yea
haha
i did hota phys lit
for my hl's
i did lit/phil/phys
phil wouldve been rlly lit
how similar was it to tok
or not at all
well we had ibsl phil and tok rolled into one
wtf?
that's crazy
we had 2 years of tok and no phil
^
I saw ToK
Thanks for the heart attack
t h e o ry  o f  k n o w l e d g e
tok was just like a lil bit of ibhl phil
tbh i dont remember much of tok at all
I remember nothing
phil wouldve been really cool tho
all u need to remember
The debut headmaster wasn't that great at teaching it
is ways of knowing
and areas of knowledge
and stanford prison experiment
and milgram
<:ew:619334178357641237>
Oh I remember
idk how but i swear ive taken 5 classes with milgram/stanford prison experiment
I've taken a fair few
Just always remember
tok, cogs 14a, poli 13d
some other cogs
i swear
Stanford social research
=
Evil
ive seen it voer and over
<:pepeLMAO:490384254534942720>
imagine still having humanities in college
i miss phil
revelle doesnt have to imagine
xd
Imagine having any ethics in your research

huh?
usually p/np
none
i have a letter grade for the ib diploma
wacky
wtf?
screenshot it
oh what
randy ib is kinda diff xd
sometimes
ik some schools will take
ur ib grades
instead of a transcript
bc 7 = a, 6 = a-, 5 = b+, etc etc it's kinda weird
but im p sure i dont have a grade

<@!595010202613317632> i thought that was weird too

as u can see
i did not get >5 in either physics or hota

sg!events
yeeee just finished watching first round of it
wait theres a fruit tierlisting wtf
yes
click on the hyperlink for more info
LOL
its ok
i already know watermelon will win S tier fruit
is durian included?
and thats all i care about
S tier durian?
durian is like low A high B tier
imo
mm that's fair
i only derank it because it smells terrible
yeah i cant deal with the smell either
also also if u have people who dont know the smell of durian around they might think its a gas leak and then force an evacuation of the current building the durian is residing in so
ye oof
durian F tier
fight me
tmw
er
sunday
also i hate durian so personally id give it like F tier but some ppl think its good
so im being unbiased
O
LOL
i wished i liked durian
yeah ppl who like durian rly like it
my tastebuds are degenerate
i generally avoid it bc the smell
I like durian
Which is funny because I thought I wouldn‚Äôt like the taste
WAIT LOL I JUST REALIZED
vanilla is a fruit
????
wait rly? i thought it was beans?
oh shit it is
Vanilla is the only edible fruit of the orchid family, the largest family of flowering plants in the world. There are over 150 varieties of vanilla plants. Just like grapes that make wine, no two vanilla beans are the same in flavor, aroma, or color. Vanilla is still the most favorite ice cream flavor in the US
copypasta
:0
today i learned smthg new
vanilla is s tier fruit LOL
yes pls
welcome!
Welcome!
hullo!
welcomeeee
where'd today's influx of ppl come from?
welcome!! also durian s tier
blasphemous
tropical fruits slap so hard
it's the SMELL if it weren't for the methane-y smell a lot more ppl would like it
literally its only fatal flaw
eating durian is like eating custard
s tier fruits can't have fatal flaws
METHANE
it's against the rules
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
hm thts reasonable
a tier
how you gonna have an S teir and then tell me it smells like shit
now starfruit
anyways
that's an s tier fruit
save this for the event peeps
lots of lively fruit discussion awaits
What's cracking whores

:^)
OH FR
<:nyello:441469558423814144>
üòÑ
f
truly hate it here
i will never hate ppl not even the ppl that fuk me over
but america? ez money
my parents and i were discussing
trump wants to host some event?
and says masks not required
yeah i think
at mount rushmore ?
Isn't that yesterday?
oh
no idea
litearlly what antimaskers in this country wouldnt feel empowered
LOL
oh i also dunno
but
just
i hate stupid people like this
fucking
~ natural selection ~ stoof
hell bro
YEA CAN NATURE SELECT TRUMP
GOD DAMMN
so stupid
antimaskers are stupid
unless u have a respiratory problem
shut yo dumbass up
Antimaskers protest in front of city halls, cops do nothing
Peaceful BLM protests, cops attack
media do be twisting stuff as well <:FeelsBadMan:441463646124507136>
Antimaskers show up with assault rifles, nothing
but yea its kinda bs
FR HOLY
that armed people
those two ppl holding guns and no one doing anything
arent stopped
Yell in cop's faces, nothing
Shove cops, nothing
but they can't keep tht same energy towards Black folx. damn. double standardds
the state of america XDD
It's infuriating
and people still voting trump
it really is
our "leader" is allowing all of this
> and people still voting trump
<@!303002872646467596> yeah|| like my parents||
hes encouraging it in fact
im sorry sandy
my mom still supports trump
but thankfully
she cant vote
üá®üá¶
that honestly really sucks
LMFAOOO RICHARD
LMAO wichawd thats <:stonks:713344926418731018>
honestly my parents may have disliked hillary more than trump in the past
but
trump has proven himself
my dad supported trump 2016
to be like 1920301x worse than hillary couldve ever been
a lot of my friends supported trump 2016
most of my friends parents supported trump 2016
but thats changed 2020
but my mom still supports trump and idgi
As horrid as Hillary was, I fail to understand how she could be worse than Trump.
hes just a horrible person who is ruining the progress of civil rights, lgbt, and lots of other movements to improve society
and hes not a politician
tru
Civil rights wasn't progressing under Obama
AND THE ENVIRONMENT
and his position at the head of this country is the reason no one takes covid seriously
he's taking away so many protections etc
my friends dad was adamantly against hillary bc he thought she would take away his gun
the
old ass
one
he
didnt
use
and has never used
besides keeping it in a display cas
e
BRUH
im not saying it was but at least it wasnt like moving backwards
> Civil rights wasn't progressing under Obama
and thats the issue
Yeah, true
why the fuck are white supremacists back again
They were always here I guess
ppl that fight for the 2nd amendment are the same who say that "the violence at protests and the riots are unnecessary"
ye but now theyre more confident bc trump supports them indirectly
his words
perpetuate stereotypes
that america has worked hard to get rid of
i go sleep now bc tiredo
night cuties
fuck trump
gn!
and thats what i hate most
gn ninaa
also obama worship needs to stop
üëÄ
> fuck trump
<@!286708165612011531> FAX NO PRINTEEERRRR
bc too many ppl like him for the wrong rzns
i think there isnt a perfect
world leader
def
trudeau is arguably problematic
i aint worshipping no one but trump is just terrible as a leader and person
harper wasnt gr8 either
everyone has their flaws
oabam wasnt perfect
but trump ??? BRUV
bush jr was not good
nah i wasn't saying u were
but in general
the trump / bolsonaro / johnson trifecta is ?????????/ tho
for world politics
like its enabling so much ignorance around the globe
ppl rlly like obama bc he was so cool n charismatic which yeah worked to gain him favor
ohhh yeaaa trump is the most ignorant bitch on the block
but ultimately he made some p rough decisions tht killed a lotta ppl
to support obama was to proclaim that U Were Not Racist bc U Had A Black Friend
if u were a white male
political correctness dne in his dictionary
smfh
and his wall bullshit
> dne
ok
cs major
wait
nvm
bitch we need to focus on controlling covid
not immigrants or trespassers
LITERALLY
i cant believe people really treat covid like a social construct or some shit
at this pt its probably better to just tell trump we're going for herd immunity
like fuck
so he stays out of it
like holy shit
also ppl being detained by ICE need attention as well <:PeepoCry:694447846056787998>
we are reaching new fucking heights
of daily increases
the first wave isnt even over yet
LMFAOOO OK DID YALL SEE MY STORY
and we're at >50k cases a day
him: covid will disappear
no
no
ON IG
BASICALLY
IT WAS A VOICEOVER
so the video was of the progression in # cases of covid world wide
u know that graph
and the voiceover was
trump saying
that we're gonna keep winning
IVE SEEN THAT LMFAOOO
its so funny
but so
morbid
LMFAOOO
bc every joke made at trump's expense about covid resonse
is someone's mother, father, grandma, etc. dying
bc as political as this is
TRU
he's literally throwing lives away
didnt trump say something about beating the second wave
bro the first wave isnt over yet
and we r losing
i hate that the wellbeing of ppl in the country + racism have to be politicized
bitch there wont be a second wave if we dont get over the first one
<:pepeClown:725782107653406770>
like racism is not a political discussion
I‚Äôm ready for the third wave in San Diego
ur either against it or .... literally for it
PEOPLE'S HEALTH IS NOT POLITICAL SHIIIT
LIKE
As I go to ikea later today
FR
WEARING A MASKS IS NOT POLITICAL
JUST HAVE COMPASSION FOR OTHERS
ITS FOR EVERYONES GOOD
INSTEAD OF THE MF ECONOMY
haircuts arent political
FOR FUCKS SAKE YALL
covid isnt political
etc
To be pedantic, anything the parties debate about is by definition political
just dont fucking go outside
especially if ur a student
CANT HAVE AN ECONOMY IF THERE ARENT PPL
did u guys see
the alabama covid parties
where people were
sandy i just sent u the video
fucking
trying
to
get
covid
asfdbhu
oihfsgjdfaophbijfnsd
eheh just saw lemme watch!!
I think the covid parties were a hoax
YEAH RICHARD
YEA OK I HOPE THEY ALL GET THEIR WISH
stoopid binches
i dont wish death for people
but i hope they get it
and suffer
i hope they dont bc they can spread it to others
the consequences
bc realistically
they wont fucking self isolate
so
TRUE
these fuckers
LMAOO JUST WATCHED IT
in reality covid aint the disease
its humans
BUT LITERALLY KOREA HANDLED IT SO WELL
I wouldn't wish covid on anyone. It sounds dreadful.
and usa over here..... clown shit
humanity is a fucking disease
YEA HAHAHA KOREA WAS LIKE YALL HEAR SOMETHING
its mind boggling that
#<:ponyo:717961077174042654>
any pharm corp
<:ponyo:717961077174042654>
would use this
as an opportunity to profit
as >100k americans die
like ig capitalism but like
capitalism UNFORTUNATELY
???????????????/
theres this video of a woman who's like
like epipens too
"theres no excess of people dying this year compared to any other year"
HAHAHHA tell that to the hospitals that are almost at capacity
i mean if people didnt go outside
they wouldnt get shot, hit by cars, etc
tell that to the morgues that are filling up with bodies
fall off cliffs
so i guess
omg that reminds me
everytime i bring up covid to my dad
statistically it might be possible that less ppl die of certain causes
yea if i dont get tested i wont have covid
ya feel
trump's onto something
with that peanut brain
he says "ooh so you think we don't risk our lives to car acccidents? smoking? obesity?"
like stop mf deflecting wtFFFF
the diff is that
wtf how is that relevant
one is preventable
reeeeeee
and one is seredipidity
TRUE
thats facts
u cant control a drunk driver flying into u
^
but u can control covid spread
That is the stupid defense
like my dad just does not understand
üëè
and my grandma lives w us too
and i told him like its a risk
and also like
re: obesity
we know obesity is bad
bruh im hella paranoid about covid
him: do YOu KNoW hoW SmAll thst Risk iS
but not because imma die
so we u kno .. .try to avoid being obese
so
its cuz my grandma will fucking die
if any of us gets it
and like
people who dont take covid seriously
dont get that or something
that people
die from this
> so we u kno .. .try to avoid being obese
<@!595010202613317632> one day i hope u argue with my dad i want to see it go down
and they also dont get
that the world doesnt fucking revolve around them
sandy
that not every fucking thing is about this
im scared of ur dad
also
its impossible to debate w people like that
my moms like that
UR RIGHT
i've been trying for years god
he brainwashes my sister
üò¶
o no
the other day he went "you know democrats have a higher covid rate than republicans?" to my little sister
LIKE TF
I once knew a Trump supporter who insisted to me in a room of NASA engineers that climate change wasn't real
LMAOOOOOOOOOO some clown shit
POLITICAL PARTIES LITERALLY DO NOOOOTTTT MAAATTTEERRRR
BRO WHAT
You can't argue with these clowns
ok so
if democrats have a higher covid rate
why would it be a democrat
conspiracy
why would they
give it to themselves
instead of republicans
yea and did u know people who dont wear masks prob have a higher covid rate than people who do ??
worst conspiracy theory ever
people who are like blah blah blah explain the science of masks
also technically
bitch its the same as covering your cough
i dont get how its hard to understand
You see, social distancing and quarantine spreads COVID
do u not have a single brain cell
if democrats have a higher rate its bc republicans arent wearing their fucking masks but democrats are
therefore republicans dont get it from dems and reps give it to dems
BASED ON MY DAD"S LOGIC
wait though that actually kinda makes sense
the Republicans give it to the Democrats
wait its 3 am i did not even comprehend what i wrote
And then refuse to get tested
wow big brain
i think we're onto something
omg wauw
<:AnimeInsane:615441328720838656>
also hope we're all registered to vote! ||settling for biden in dis bich i dont want a cheeto in office pls||

n argo = revelle so
oHH hahaha
then says something about my roommate being uptight and how hes jealous of me for having my life together (which isnt tru but ill take it)
on second thought i dont remember this story
unless this leads up to it
> lex is fucking scary hes jumped at me with a knife twice
wht in the hell
hes from broward
and after that he starts to like taper out and im thinking aight hes finally knocking out
which doesnt sound like a reasonable explanation but if u grow up in broward / buffalo / detroit / chicago it's not as surprising
wht is a broward
broward fl
ah
so me and david r just talking to each other about random shit at like 1 and then rish starts to like convulse
floridians
its where x, lil pump, smokepurpp, skimask, etc r from
Florida Man
rlly sus place
the huntington beaches of oc
**i see florida man**
<:yeehaw:614195699919093772>
as soon as he started twitching im like _fuck hes gonna throw up_
i dont think anyone in a coastal region of california can understand what rust belt / those kinds of places r like
oh
wait
nvm
yall look up ur bday and florida and see wht fuckshit happened in fl on tht day
i know where this is going
imagine living in florida
> i dont think anyone in a coastal region of california can understand what rust belt / those kinds of places r like
<@!595010202613317632> we get it ur not originally from cali
so i throw him onto his side facing away from the bed _for some god damn reason he starts fighting me and wanting to face into the bed_
<:xd:612726759846051861>
_so he fucking yacks onto ramiros bed_
kdjfhgkjfdhjgkhkjdhf
struggle's real
GOD
OH MY GOD
eye-
OH GOY DGODFODOFODOGOD
poor ramiro
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
and at this point he hasnt had anything but vodka and cheerios so as hes throwing up its just like
rip ramiro's bed
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
i remember this

<:xd:612726759846051861>
slfknsdfn
and so its just me and my suitemate alone in someone elses room in someone elses bed while rish is yacking
