yo wtf this some 1984 shit
<:monkaS:442185930867081218>
BIG BIRB IS ALWAYS WATCHING
irene is a bitch
<a:birbdance:614609682446680066>

alright everyone proceed with your normal conversations, jsut know the thought police wil come get you
<:omaewa:442183539341918209>
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
yum
delicious
mmm
<:yourdeath:713653810211586141>
poor jasons gonna have to regex all these emotes out later
However if your minds are thotty then the thot police with cum get you
not the thot police
imagine using regex and not manually deleting
loli
oh no
<:shook:606018427018149889>
<a:ieatass:577482949130321941>
here they come
how does it handle embeds
noice
not gonna lie i have no idea
does it note commands that r deleted
i didnt even put in a try-catch block
yes
this will be broken before it gets anything cool
it catches anything that is instantly sent
shiiii
cant even hide
<:uwudaddy:606017963308613636>
you can
because we dont document who sent it
just that it was
so in theory it could just be 1 person talking to themselves and big birb will never know
got it
i think we need to become dictators again with this shit
alright everyone start popping off
Discord chatterbot
pop off
wait i wonder if they already have that
Ben drowned
**crickets**
<@!186322067111542784> and i are anxious to start making a bot that can just pretend to be u guys
**crickets**
can't you just steal the chatterbot code?
i mean take inspiration from
well this one wont converse with u
itll just steal ur words
its like autocorrect
er
THOT thievery
autocomplete
auto discord
we wont even need ttalk
just have bots talk in a seperate channel
call it
LOL
ttalk 2.0
Bot talk
finally a place where i can speak freely
the goal is
to have a bot that will just
shit out sentences
<a:thonkRotate:585659541329412106> if two bots dm each other ... we will never see that conversation
my smol brain cannot comprehend majority of this conversation
so this is how the robot invasion starts huh
can it also barf out sentences?
i've stopped trying to read
automation 100
okay sdimple speak, bot reads bot speakes
oh fuck maybe im too smol brain for this conversation too
hopefully i can gather enough data but not too much to break the entire server it runs on lol
just wait till 3am
thats when the bot will break
i sure hope not

I am not a weeb <:ucsd:441455775899189248>
i almost appled into neuro <:wsVsU7mxSU2FdfU5NtpgQA_thumb_470:688600982212706336>
oh nice
Well APPLY FOR A MAJOR CHANGE
*only if you want to and have given it deep consideration beforehand*
neuro is pretty interesting i'll give you that i just haven't decided what i want to speciailize in ig  ???????
<:thonk:440231969796784128>
I heard neuro
Evening
That's perfectly fine and you have a lot of time ahead to explore what the biological sciences have to offer you.
yupyupyup
> cog sci
ü§î
*ill take it*
<:thonk:440231969796784128>
dw brochacho i'll come straight to you if i do decide on neuro xD
<:thowonking:712569034209493042>
I'd be in Bio but I couldn't take those general courses
I feel like both neurobiology and psychology kiddos shit on cog sci
Way too much of just learning what I already got taught
Cogs shits back on psych
But we can't do much
'cause experimental psychology
And behavioural neuroscience
I'm more of a do everything kinda guy
when psychology finally starts becoming more recognized as doing hard science things <:thinkies:713308987843674153>
But its actually just evolved into a different field
my dad shits on psych <:FeelsStrongManW:650822412287475744>
Which is exactly what UCSD cogs did
> my dad shits on psych :FeelsStrongManW:
<@!652073170890915864> :reeeeeeee:
<:reeeeeeee:694835050189160509>
clinical psychology is getting much more neurosciencey nowadays too
Cogs evolved into data science/design
The OG CSE/philosophy/ethnographic stuff is kinda dead
> <@!652073170890915864> :reeeeeeee:
<@!245736329382461440> Expected of my father bruh
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
this is not a Surpise
It's interesting to see how much the discipline is evolving.
I'm in Cogs because I can't ever pick one thing to do
It might change again, we recently got a new head of the department
And Don Norman leaves in July
Forever
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
What if there was a clinical neuropsychology class <:scrunchthink:440232169919610880>
So we can kiss our money goodbye
i mean major
Not more majors
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
You can petition for a new major btw
Theres already like 10 different neuro-esque majors
what are they
Well theres neuro
I know of cog sci neuro specialization
Cogs specialism
Psych has one I believe
And Cogs Psych is evolving into it
technically theres old majors too like physio and neuro but that doesnt count tbh
Bio has a focus
Theres possibly more coming too
There's no neuro psych major yet
Its coming
I need to read up on this if there's a place
A part of the issue is all the departments wanting a piece of the pies
Because they think they 'own' the major
Like Maths vs Jacobs over CSE
There's already the joint cognitive and behavioral neuroscience major
> maths
<:monkaHmm:516388020895612961>
Our CSE started in maths
And Natural Sciences
Hence why its not a *traditional* CS major
There were big faculty fights back in the day
I had one of said faculty teach me last year
That's the thing with interdisciplinary such-and-things
Its starting with cogs now too
We've got fights over HCI/Data Science
And even Design
"and even design" lmao
(Do we, or do we not have a Design major?)
yes
But then the problem with a Design major
I heard of it sometime
Is it won't be what people think it is
*Design* in the Design Lab sense
Is everything from architecture, to data science
What happened to the ol' classic fashion design?
Hell my group alone has a bio, cogs, and CSE professor
Design is everything

CogSci/Math
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
What the fuck
I like it
Whoever you are
Yes
Is that a double major I see?
Jim Hollan is gonna like you
Or is that a specialization
Double Major
I think it's too late for me to reconsider a clinical psychology major.
That or a double in Data Science is the ultimate HCI move
Which is where the big data science / cocks money is nowadays
Algorithms
Hello friends
<:monkaGIGA:585569750281748481>
I wish people were more interested in neuroscience so I can talk with them about it and share our passions <:pepehands:464568955533524992>

<@!213151486434082817> now u have to tell us

Sleep paralysis is scary because I have no idea what's going on
thank god ive never had sleep paralysis
sounds scary as all hell
I had it like _once_
And it was freaky
it IS
i've had it three times
never again pls
sleep paralysis was a very interesting  experience
it's freaky once you start hearing stuff
what's it like
oh it just made me realize C&BT is not really my thing, but the girl was hot enough that I kidna sat through it, but I was not enjoying my time
i don't think i've ever experienced

poor bby
Shit hurted
lmao
im kinda scared to ask wat c$bt r
<:
so please no stomping
o
OH

oh god
bru
i left it as an acronym to not trigger anyone
or mashing
or or or
randy said search at ur own risk
i think a slight step is permissible
uh oh
wait no
but the amt of pressure
i forgot to mention it was 2 people one enjoying themselves, and one doing the deed
is impt
bc you don't wna do permanent dmg
It hurts to have a rider sometimes, especially when they skinny
You seem to have a lot of knowledge about this
im scared to join this convo
<:nyello:441469558423814144>

<:FeelsStrongManW:650822412287475744>
almost like bones r super hard
mmmm
yes
those r the best kind
they do be hard most of the time
<:yeet:442868651792793601>
horny on main
no just anatomical
are bones supposed to be soft <:hyperJ:694448211439648809>
we're tlaking about the density of bones
excuse me
lets be honest this isn't main
imagine having bones tht can shift phases
imagine having bones
<:AnimeInsane:615441328720838656>
sorry bone goes from solid to slightly less solid
imagine
not liquid
become amorphous jelly<:stonks:713344926418731018>
if it turns to liquid you have a problem
might wanna get that checked out homie
this reminds me of that one family guy ep
if it turns to gas, well good luck
bye bye bone marrow <:zoop:435223493311725573>
but yeah CBT is a thing, i don't understand the enjoyment but to each their own
kekekekee

OH
I JUST REALIZED WHAT CBT MEANT
i feel like people that are into it are sorta masochistic?
<:Cryga:576487215102689290>
is that the term or is sadistic?
cognitive behavioral therapy is gr8
nope had it rihgt to start
sadism = named after this french d00d named sade
like the more pain the better for them
but idk
who wrote rlly fked up sexual narratives centered around pain
No pain no gain
oh no
- my math teacher
egh
sadism = dishes out pain, enjoys it
yee yee
i just read up on it again
we love light reading before bed
now what about slight choking kekekeke
sorry we could move to another disc
ofc tiktok is the thing that makes the 24 talk
also randy wat kinda books do u read
books?
Psychological domination anyone?
i odn't read unless forced
no no no, thats manipulation
> ofc tiktok is the thing that makes the 24 talk
<@!345083648124649485> tiktok izz fun
it izz what it izz
LOL
F am i too zoomer
shhh its ok if it works it works
> now what about slight choking kekekeke
<@!213151486434082817> if ur not doing it hard ur not doing it right
tiktok is okay
i get my tiktok content from twitter and ig i can't lie
secondhand tiktok
JK JFKSHFJKHSFJS BAD ADVICE
squeeze from sides, don't press down
oh i already learned that lesson
ekekeke
> i get my tiktok content from twitter and ig i can't lie
<@!245736329382461440> tiktok funni
the hard way or
little bit of both
there can still be too much pressure, but yes only from the sides
idk each person is different too
speaking of not knocking anyone out by c-wording them too much, i'm gna ktfo soon
tru
communicate with ur partners n all tht jazz
learn how to read peoples bodies, it suprisingly works in every day situations as well
> communicate with ur partners n all tht jazz
<@!286708165612011531> yes yes yes, idk how much times i need to give this advice to couples
even friends in general
funny how college ppl don't understand tht boundaries r a thing
i mean being able to communicate is always where its at
Communication is hard.
it isn't once you get comfortable with telling people how you feel
you should never hold that back
causes problems
that can be avoided
which i get is hard sometimes if ur not used to asking for wht u want
People don't want me to tell them how I feel :/
trust me, I know this from experience
I do recall me being straight forward but yeah 90% of people online are too scared especially if they've met someone in person
I mean there is a certain aspect of telling people how you feel, starting out with peole and telling them your entire life story can be hard
they're scared of what happens next
but as long as you're an aduly
adult
and handle it like one
and don't word it poorly
you should be good
Wording can make or break the feel of a sentence
and dont be afraid to call someone
because text is hard
^^
tone is better when talked not texted
If you're really unsure of both text and call, sometimes taking the time to step back think and write about it always helps
> People don't want me to tell them how I feel :/
<@!252670263848599563> this is rlly disheartening to hear
i love using "i feel" statements bc it doesn't point fingers at the other party, and i avoid starting disagreements with "you did xyz"
ppl get defensive quite easily
i'll move this to srs bc it's gna be long and then im gna head to bed
sleep is for the week!
> i love using "i feel" statements bc it doesn't point fingers at the other party, and i avoid starting disagreements with "you did xyz"
<@!286708165612011531> agreed and i think a lot of ppl mistakenly use "you did xyz"
so yes get some sleep so you can power through the week
oh lordy, its already midnight
ummmmm acahgtaually its 20 minutes past midnight
lol
how is the writing going jenny
terribly XD
but its fine, i'll finish before deadline for sure

<:pepepoog:606017447623131166>
End goal for me would prob be astronaut tho
I want to be the first asian on mars
Well maybe not mars specifically
But you get the point
But unfortunately space is a very competitive field
So im ok with not accomplishing that
But its more of like a dream rather than a realistic goal for me rn lmao
Maybe some day tho
Yoo
Where did everyone go
Twas poppin just a second ago
class
Ahh
Damn everyone has class at the same time?
12pm class hits different
I mean i guess my classes are all morning
But i never go to them
Yea i have a class in 30 min lmao
I dont want to go to class tho im still in bed and naked
for me its the sudden realization that this week is kinda important
where its my last chance to determine whether or not i am p/np or full send all letter grades
Oh fuuck
aka starting on work assigned 4 weeks ago
I felt that tho
i think i need to change one class to p/np
> ||I dont want to go to class tho im still in bed and naked||
<@!219584106550263809> just to let you know, this is tmi

tbh it was tmi in general
^^
cuz lost in translation

Ok
Hows rhis
I dont want to go to class bc im still in bed and not dressed
better
but maybe just say you're still in your pfs
pjs*
nothing would be left to interpretation
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
Oki doki then
Under our clothes
We are all naked
heresy
What I said was true, from a certain point of view
true, but not needed
ur  skin  covers ur bones üôÇ
bold of you to assume i have a physical corporeal form
To be fair the convos get p weird in here
is it possible to have a spiritual corporeal form
im going to bath and body works for a new vessel anyone need anything
Like andrews
I‚Äôm still in bed and tired
Siamese twins
i'd like a new back
hi still in bed and tired
grow one diana
just cut ur old one off
I woke up at 5am to watch a stray kids mv and then went back to sleep
bath and body works <:PatrickGasm:600914637940326400>
it'll grow back soon!
Nick
oooooo
I need a body that works
maybe that's why i havent grown taller
damn, same wilson
Still in bed gang
i wish i was still in bed üò≠
<@!405810391025713156> i dont remember anyone asking but thanks
tru u just need to keep cutting off parts of ur  body until they regrow to to what u like
y'all ever wake up from a dream/nightmare and just feel hella exhausted?
Yea
Thats called life
like i just used all my brain power to dream that shit up instead of resting
Still waiting to wake up
I have a midterm to study for but I am tired
And a paper to do
when i get out of having a dream and i spend brain power wondering how i could think up those random faces/monsters i see
Only got 300 words done <:kek:490008924414803968>
what's it on?
the essays this week are wackkk
A jazz artist
Ugh I have to write an essay in a class I don't even remember the content of
i have to present an article today and i havent found an article to present yet
.
imagine having a synthesis essay about 5 authors being put into 2 pages
that sounds like hell
ouch
essays sound bad
ah
thankfull no warren writing or phil for me these past two  quarters ü•∞
its going to be interesting
it's bliss to not have wcwp
when you misclick the friend request button and make someone sad :(
i mean its more like an opinion piece but using ideas that we learned in the class
and "bringing in fresh ideas"
heres a fresh idea
> I woke up at 5am to watch a stray kids mv and then went back to sleep
<@405810391025713156> an actual mood
Imagine being in warren
Wait
imagine being
tfw there's a vlive at 3am
tfw im only in hum 2 and dying and theres 5 hums üôÉ
imagine
i still have yet to do hum 5 lmao
I don‚Äôt even watch vlives anymore because they all happen at 5am
<:PEPESCREAM:466446495747670027>
im becoming a senior
wtf
have you done one at a CC, randy?
nope
ok old man<@213151486434082817>
maybe take hum 5 at cc?
if they offer
my back hurts lmao
Dw Jenny it gets better
i heard hum at a CC is the strat
my arm hurts
yeah but we're only allowed to take 1, nick
Like mmw 14 and 15 were much easier than first three
transfer to warren jenny üôÇ
i mean i can but i don't see a point when the class is paid for anyways
<:kek:490008924414803968>
No
hum at cc is 100% the strat
Transfer to Marshall
i did hum 4 at cc
Best college
easy, fun, chill, prof cared, history class that i learned a lot about
noted, richard
Sixth is best college excuse me
yessirrr
Im just too lazy to do the readings
this chatroom is an engine of anxiety lol
Hum classes being history related <:feelsweirdman:562445754224869376>
randy imagine doing hum readings
:^)
you gotta learn to read fast or eat ass patrick
We‚Äôre all anxious human beings
i mean skimming the readings better than not doing them at all
i mean some readings were cool but some of them
i just sparknoted bc
didnt want t do it
like francis bacon was so ?????
ive increased my typing speed purely from this server
Imagine reading the readings assigned to you
why not both, dino
Eating ass <:PatrickGasm:600914637940326400>
the more the merrier
Hum 5 is better because its more psychological than historical
wait jenny
sorta related but sorta not
tbh i feel like the speed which we type is a deterent for new ppl sometimes
can u ride a skateboard
I don‚Äôt even type that fast
the chat goes 0-100 rlly fucking fst
fast
sometimes
I can‚Äôt type at all
or theres multiple conversations
i mean its like were trying to have a normal conversation but with 20 people
but maybe that sjsut the way it is
ü¶ß
and theres like 5 different conversations going on at once
<@!87652481768620032> no but i wanna learn
all about weird topics
Like rn
why?
how tf was that related at all lmao
see like jenny and nick are having a conversation
Nick
while were having a conversation
yEEt
diana  said skate fast or eat ass

Tbh I feel that
I want to roam campus at 2am again
Sit on top of buildings
ive only gone up the revelle roof during day time i feel like i should go up there at night some time
keeling roof*
jump off said building
san diego has so much potential for cool places and i cant wait to bring my car
but its prob crowded bc ik my suitemates went up there with some other people to smoke or something
like theres def so many scenic spots no one rlly goes to
yea ppl did that at keeling over ss2 last year
argo roof is accessible too
did anyone drop shit from there this year
bc last year my friends dropped a pumpkin
and hydroflasks
welcome <@!273916092294889473> !!!
to see if the flask would break
ah i heard fall quarter people were cheating on cse21 on argo roof
sun go dieded so we are manually verifying
Welcome!
wait what LOL
like 20-30 of them were just doing their PAs up there lmao
there's pa's in 20/21?
i thought it was math ...
wow welcome!
bro ....
Welcome!! <@!273916092294889473> <:banzai:442185100273123328>

thank you guys
nah it was mbmb
shouldve assumed
sorry
another revelle man
NO its MY fault
IM sorry
NO ITS MINE
NO ITS MINE
gdi jenny
NOOO
IM sorry
im sorryER
11 wasn't that hard...
<:kirbygun:613942917135990803> let me say sorry, bitch
welcome!
ikr, Luke
we can both be equally sorry :)
i was like
why you gotta cheat on 11
imagine cheating
my friend got AI'd in 11 bc he let this girl copy this PA
yikes
ok tbf i copied off stackexchange for one q on cse 11 pa2
i think
but i didnt like
copy the whole thing
and then
i didnt get off the waitlist
anyways
F
ai tbh
F
is something kinda hard to obtain
honestly
like unless you're copying word for word 80% of thetime
im fucking appalled that no one got ai'd for sio15
people literally copied word for word
on the hw's
at that point you deserved to get aied
like if ur gonna cheat be smart about it
^^
this is not condoning cheating
<:think:613867581522313231>
but theres so much undetected cheating esp on copying hw
well if you're smart, you shouldnt be cheating in the first place
<:think:613867581522313231>
i have no idea how no one got caught in cogs 18
considering
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
someone posted the "exam" jupyter notebook
onto chegg
well
school smarts < street smarts
for someone else to write their code
yea what luke said
99 wouldnt understand
üôÉ
:^)
nhu .
integrity doesnt exist in the real world cheat ur heart out
that's ok, i dont understand a lot of things
lmao
nhu here
to spit facts
well that‚Äôs a rather drab way to look at the world nhu
the real world is dog eat dog, eat or be eaten üò†
By that same logic people are shitty so we shouldn‚Äôt have morals
does anyone else nut for excel sheets
slurp or be _slorp_
people are very shitty
can confirm
this is philosophy time
jk wrong time
i have no faith in humanity or people
doesn‚Äôt mean you have to be shitty too üôÇ
yes, dino
disregard me pls
excel sheets <:PatrickGasm:600914637940326400>
i shall catch up
yessss Dino
Lol
Excel sheets
With COLORS
I use excel to plan my classes
And FORMULAS
COLORED EXCEL SHEETS?!?!?!??! <:PatrickGasm:600914637940326400>
excel sheetsssss
fuccckkk
real world is actually haha life go brr
The colors are so pretty
esp when all of your equations line up perfectly
organization <:PatrickGasm:600914637940326400>
oooo
yah but i dont think "cheating" is shitty
i dunno i think the entire schooling system (esp at big schools where exams determine 80% of ur grade) is deeply flawed
and using ur resources to best apply urself to courses and subjects that u will never have to know by heart isn't smth that is that bad
i mean this qtr is a good example of that
i think copying an exam is ba
bc u learn nothing
bad
but its pretty obvious a lot of people zoom call
during midterms
this quarter
AI is one of those gray area
and i think that if people are working together through it, they demonstrate an understanding of the knowledge and find a workaround to this rlly fucked up quarter
so its kinda
fine
imo
^
bc end of the day ur paying a fuckton for school
and plus teamwork is a huge part of
so its ur prerogative to actually learn
so
"real world" careers
like in the real world im never gonna be shut in a room with a proctor who asks me to calculate the momentum of a spring tied to a pully or some shit
like id ... be able to google or ask people
like i havent cheated during exams but i can empathize w ppl who have
u'd never ever be penalized for collaborating w colleagues either
nah
if u ask ur colleague
what the time is
instantly fired
LOL
no reference for ur next job
the ceo personally decapitates u
blacklisted for life
yup
richard go to
penguin
ok
club penguin online which server üëÄ üëÄ üëÄ
jk
Didn't CPO get shut down
ive never played cpo
sun god is temp down
more glitch problems D:
i just think the pfp is a funny meme
:(
F
Why is everyone green now
bc in order to beat ucds
ucsd
u have to leave ucsd first
when u gap quarter the nhu shit green council will consider ur eligibility
can you guys waitlist for classes?
you can't waitlist on first pass
second pass you can
but you can waitlist ss tho <:AnimeInsane:615441328720838656>
ah
this is what happens when i have priority for two years

F
oh you only have priority for two years?
yeah
I had that
with the First Gen Success Coaching Program
ah i see
I miss prio enrollment <:PepeHands:504520804466163732>
is anyone in math 180a this quarter
does anyone know if
ur discussion
matters
cuz
when i had it di didnt matter
do u learn anything useful in di?
bc rmp says au goes hella fast / isnt gr8
highkey not rlly
ok bet

wait
wheres matt
dead
trying to do hw
asleep
i feel uncomfortble bc its been too quiet
its getting closer to finals
makes sense
oh ok
y'all ever just write in bursts?
like i'll write 2 pages in 30 mins then not do anything productive for like an hr
ME
holy crud
writing my essays its 2 paragraphs of good things then i go awol for like 4 hours and then return
I have a question
With the VAC, does each question have to be a different submission?
i dont think so
i mean if its like completely different questions like one on your major and another question on like a different topic
then yes
put your finger down if your code doesnt work because you used a variable called nu instead of the variable ni and you spent more than 6 hours wondering what was wrong to the point that you went to all of the office hours for both your TA and professor and they couldnt tell you what was wrong and you figure it out when you finally decide to just rewrite the entire thing over again
it's me
im bitches
<:pepehands:464568955533524992>
my friend did the same thing for our last pa D:
she rewrote it 3 times before she figured out that she didnt loop back
i felt that
i still have another problem to debug
reeeeeeeee
fuck
D:
that hurts to read
the amount of spelling errors i made
coding for me is like reading
yes
tr
i wont understand it the first or second time
tru
if i stare at one thing for too long it all blurs
i can relate
and it takes hours for me to understand a single passage
this is why i haven't started on my project yet
D:
uh oh
coding hard
it's due friday of finals week so watch me do it the last minute <:kek:490008924414803968>
lmao
thats me with doc rn
how's doc 3
i havent started on my research project yet
planning on getting drunk sometime and slapping my keyboard until something comes out
big brain
i do that except the drunkenness
<:kek:490008924414803968>
my essay makes 0 sense but i need to finish the motivation to just type whatever
like i keep hesitating bc im like damn i wanna make this better but its not getting any better and i really just need to get it done
try speedrunning it
time urself and go for a pb lmao
i bs my doc 3 paper last year
and somehow ended up with an A- in the class
yeah
ooo
i dont think effort scales with grade in doc
yeah i keep setting myself deadlines with time
and its not going well XD
i was like ah imma finish this by 8
oh no
i only have 3/5 pages written
*oh no*
<:PEPESCREAM:466446495747670027>
i have an essay due thursday
only have 300 words down
i have 800 words atm D:
it's due thursday morning too
but the assignment says midnight
i've been baited
<:kek:490008924414803968>
i was gonna work on it after my midterm
"was gonna"
<:pepehands:464568955533524992>
i should probably start my research project now
yes
brb gonna get some alc
o
you know I think coding is a lot like poetry
and nobody likes poetry
*blinks in emily dickinson*
*and walt whitman*
*and ocean vuong*
aight time to start drinking and doing doc
charles ur a phat mood idk how u write drunk tho
tht's a feat
<@!286708165612011531> nows probably a good time to learn that vietnamese
someone once said write drunk, edit sober and i mean. can't disagree
it works
before u drink go "mot hai ba do!" tht's drunk viet 101 for ya
LMAO
<@!219584106550263809> didnt know you referred to yourself as nobody
üòâ
jokes aside i was our city's poet laureate
it kinda sucks how schools shove poetry down ppls throats
I meean
and it becomes unenjoyable
You mean fulton
hi! how is everyone
to the point where it soils the beauty in a lot of other poetry
hi lisette !
and yeah
@@@@@ fulton
altho i learned a lot from that project
Makes 15 yr olds question reality
one of my favorite lines from a poem
is "i'd rather learn from one bird how to sing
than teach ten thousand stars how not to dance"
Well yea
Bc what do you get from that
At least wit the bird you now know how to sing
just caught up in chores wbu lisette
> jokes aside i was our city's teen* poet laureate
<@!433774411682938890> this is rlly dope irene

It was a joke calm down
Ofc ppl like poetry

It was a quote LMAO
<@!219584106550263809> yeah sorry i was trying to play off it too but i failed massively
idk how long but i think there‚Äôs a way to check
search your tab
in the search function
and date it by olders
oldest
don't we have a bot
*profile
yes but that requires going to the bot channel
and remembering
idfk the prefix
the commands
yea i just know the command is whois

Lmao in one of my essays i started with ‚ÄúAccording to great american poet Tupac Shakur‚Äù
AHAHAHA
Fulton did not like that one
rip tupac

randy wht's wrong with a men loving men scheme
jkjk
women >>>>>>>
is that what mlm is
<:thonk:440231969796784128>
bro i got a mlm scheme in my MAIL when my mom got the mail
from mfing vector
yes and multi lvl marketing <@!314229461396488195>
o
it's like a legal get rich quick scheme
i also got a vector letter
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
lowkey debating it
you sell knives
noooo dont do it
oo be careful dino
more struggle than it‚Äôs worth
it's not worth
i jk
our minds
but the idea is tempting
to do "nothing" and make money
MLM is so fun to fuck with
i mean the people
lmaoooo
also its multi level marketing
I remember one time this guy from hawaii contacted me in a shop, and sold me his pitch
then he contacted me later for a "interview" and sent the typical buzz words
i need someone to do me a favor
then he sent me the book
like a really big favor
that his "0ompany" uses
trying to find the person in here who did my psych100 exam for me 2 years ago. i miss them.
?? wilson??
ok so basically you know how everyone kinda had that "ho" and "party" phase their freshman year
well i never got that
and im gonna turn 20 soon
that what
what ho and party phase?
im wholesome
^
I didn‚Äôt ?
so i need someone to take me to a bunch of parties so i can bury my late teens
i h8 ppl who say they're wholesome
and let me have that phase
so i can move on
ninob? did you have a party phase?
i was dd and sober buddy all of last yr
see
nice
didn't start drinking until thxgiving 2019
she was a good student kekeke
Me but Christmas 2019
Nina
I didn't have a party phase but i enjoyed the occasional drink with my frinedos
randy was a former pbro i do not trust his defn of w(ho)l(e)some
hey hey hey, i was the most wholesome of them all
im my sororities sober sister
i'm wholesome, Ninob üôÇ
one of my pbro's was having a thing with one of the guy's girls
now i don't trust the guy
lmao fr tho
i just want to get invited to stuff
like i was finally talking to ppl
and going ojut
and the COVID hit
and im like well guess it just wasnt meant to be
like that it do be
but yea like fuck covid
just found out it was a guy named edward
is he still here
there's a lot of edwards
^
<@!206933072078307328> <@!265022881358938113> <@!645091073839857684> <@!120396270299906049>
Uhh
you're gonna have to be more sepcifieccf
wilson wtf
well cast a wider net right?
so if its one of them
lmao you didnt have to ping them
theyll come on
oh i thought that was the point
^what dino said
you gotta narrow it down first
dont ping unless you know who you're pinging
the thought counts
i meaaan theres only 4 edwards here
theyll pull through
i have faith
i know which one
the music one
nice!

See that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs good to wait
Now you could‚Äôve just pinged 1
tbh i always felt like it's a waiting game with invites to functions
he literally got me a 98 on my final in 2018. thanks edward. thinking of u rn.
<@!151123898698563584> teach me the ways of the ho pls
and take me to raves
he's a ha
wut
hes the most ho here tho
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
it‚Äôll be weird. cause ucsd isn‚Äôt a party school right
he's retired
teach me your ways jeff
yes
hes retired
UCSD students are not UCSD itself
so he has lots of wisdom
omg...
yikes
i go to a PARTY PARTY school atm
which one
Chico?
our mascot is a beer keg
LOL
I'm glad I was able to help in a time of crisis and shit internet
OH wait i remember now???
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
she asked if someone could login
and take her test
wait a sec
is that ai
<:monkaS:442185930867081218>
cause her internet destructed
my internet literally died
and i couldn‚Äôt take it on my iphone 5c cause that‚Äôs what i had until a few months ago
YOU HAD A WHAT
but yea i wanna bury my teens
ah i see
UNTIL 2019
o
an iphone 5c
A WHAT
<:bigyeet:713268953564315699>
<:YOUWHAT:714649912410898514>
it still functioned, there was no need to upgrade in my book
BABY GIRL HOW'D YOU SURVIVE
1. you join a social org that's not dry. for example vsa. not saying tht we throw functions! we just. throw social events. and then things happen when you get to know ppl and you'll get invites tht way, esp when you join our house system
2. you join a frat. pretty obvious
3. uhhhhhh lots of friends who are in those orgs. but frat parties are virtually impossible for guys to get into if ur not rushing so *:
<@!219584106550263809>  don't be discouraged by covid, a lot of ppl can't go to functions bc of it, not just you
functioning but apple stopped updating it
<:bigyeet:713268953564315699>
yeah. i got an 11 in january
<:shook:606018427018149889>
damn
from 4 inches to 6.1
yea but like hella ppl already have friends there
i'll take it
so its like easier
i was just starting out before the quarantine
and now that fall is online too
you really just have to be open to putting urself out there
i feel like i may never get that chance
im just pissed
idk how to put myself out there rn
understandable, getting a headstart in socializing is imperative to having a p solid friend grp, esp in ur first yr but like
<:thonk:440231969796784128> im very aware of vsa having a coalition formed in some way, they aint stopping me from integrating right in
<a:aniEvilPlan:657098437040537600>
ucsd asce and other orgs are still holding zoom events
and if ur gna be at ucsd in the fall, hopefully there will be on campus events?
hOPEFulliy
<:shook:606018427018149889>
i literally bailed on all of MASA's zoom events
Not any big ones
^
But there will be some small ones

<@!286708165612011531> are you jealous of my viet coffee
not quite, since it's from a boba shop
i kid, 7leaves house coffee is p gud but i do prefer making it on my own
v therapeutic
if not fresh i love using instant viet coffee packets from vn bc tht shit still hits hard
is it really viet coffee if it's not coming from the dripping thing
<a:hahakek:676470025317777484>
THE DRIPPING THING SFKJSJKFHSJDFHDS
i love the dripping thing
lmao i dont know what it's called
LOL
the french press ig
o
that sounds like a french newspaper
but it's just a coffee press
*Le Press de Francais*
yeah all my life i knew viet coffee as that drip thingy
french would be like the lil thingie tht u can push down on
same matt
wait
smells really strong and i guess gives you a heart attack if you try to sleep
yes the plunger = french press nvmnvm
have yall had cuban coffee
have yall had cuban coffee
its bomb af
got a little kick to it too
noooo is tht the kind tht u put butter in
uhhh
<:aha:612044524927057921>

you can i guess
and i think columbians put cheese in theirs sometimes which sounds v interesting
would try
OHH yea
ive had that
its hella good
theres another kind where you mix coffee and chocolate
i love coffee drinks but im more of a tea person when it comes too the pure form
i only do coffee in extreme circumstances <:shook:606018427018149889>
last time i went to 7leaves irvine i got the house coffee
and the guy was like how many shots do you want, max is 7
i was like <:monkaS:442185930867081218> <:wuh:440237146998046730>
*seven????*
btw would recommend 3-4
v tasty
but yea i was like holy SHIT sir
They are called 7 leaves <:AnimeInsane:615441328720838656>
t r u e
<:AnimeInsane:615441328720838656>
7 leaves more like 7 shots
<a:monkaShoot:699841146943176734>
guy was like pew pew pew
with your coffee
then stoof became
<a:monkaRun:713632928290046012>
i think i got 3
last time
and then i decided next time 4 was good
go for 5 next
o i misread
i thought stoof actually got 7 shots
<a:hahakek:676470025317777484>
oh my god
wait nevermind
i doubt they were the same size as coffee shop espresso shots
cuz then 7 shots would be like 75% of the cup
its like the guy who comes to CV and gets 4 shots
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
<a:hahakek:676470025317777484>
5 sometimes
actually reminds me of this guy i knew in hs
idk if he does it everyday
but I see him every saturday
he literally got like 5 shots of espresso after an all nighter
morning
p sure
its not healthy
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>

I'm trying to find an apartment to live in SD for me and my family but
LOL
Everywhere is so damn ugly
In SD
What
sd is ugly
Well La Jolla is orettt
in the city?
Pretty
or the school
i mean i know lot of people who live on base
La Jolla doesn't count
La Jolla is a Jolla
wdym, ario?
Not SD
like actual San Diego
yeah
ok
thats what i thought
?/
wtf is happening
i asked if he was saying ucsd is ugly or just sd in general
he meant the city
ah
ye
ye
<:pepeOK:490384227729408000>
also idk
i dont think it's ugly but
i love SD but you need money to live in a decent place here
i feel like the city is overrated
MUCH better than LA tho
LA is hell
LA is scary
la is hell
La is polluted as fuck
been to la can confirm
i like ucla, but i hate that city
so much
Dont like la
though i love driving there because i can be aggressive
<:aha:612044524927057921>
la noisy
Are you from la?
no
bad for nap
im in orange county
Ooo
south oc
Which city
Ahh
SC
sc?
oc oc oc
but my uncle lives in beverly hills, and i go to LA often
Dude the people in LA are scary
LA is hell to drive in
i only know westminster üôÇ
san clemente i think?
and yeah
oh
pog
correct andrew
ah San Clemente
im right above yall
their newish outlet
ario rlly south south oc
Cool cool
yuh
when he said
i live like 5 minutes away from that outlet
jenny are you genuine on league
south oc
i was like
<:shook:606018427018149889>
irvine?
u can walk there
The only oc city I‚Äôm familiar with is Irvine
yes i am, Matty
Lmao
urf?
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
Because I‚Äôve been there way too many times
san clemente
not irvine
yeah gimme like 5 minutes
ok
brb then
I EHARD OC
HELLO
u heard correctly
hello to u
dont mind ninob shes just trynna start a gan
g
heya im more up north but yessssss
i was born up north if that counts
sacc boys
don't mind andrew he's just spreading false propaganda
ooo oki i was born in fv ehe
santa ana gang
not far away at all from santa ana
like what half an hour drive north?
that aint SHIT
thats far
half and hour not hour and a half randy
idk why people think that
wait lemme see if it's north i lowkey forget which direction it's in
its north
anything within 30-40 minutes is free
yall just dont like driving
ty jenz
üëç
CANT RELATE
its like 45 to an hour from me lol
ario is
at least SC is
30 mins north to me
tfw u gotta drive to north oc for school <:sad_dab:613867302701760542>
from me santa ana is not an hour
it's like half an hour
santa ana is an hr for me
hell santa ana is already like 30 minutes at least
we get it ur from norwalk
maybe 40 mins with traffic
and like 40 to irvine
that aint much imo
i go up there regularly
i think a half hr commute is p good but 40 min is a long drive for me
nah
then again i don't drive often
people from irvine going to santa ana or norwalk lie "Im in the ghetto ratatata"
anything within an hour is ez
jwkfhjkshfjkshfjkdshf irvine/diamond bar ppl r..
sth else
even an hour or two i dont rly care as long as i got the time
^ agree with ario
like driving to UCSD is egh tbh
ok maybe not the 2 hours part
2 is a long time, but ive got friends in the valley cuz i used to live there for a while too and
i see them every so often
not a big deal for me
1.5 hours is like just the right amount of time to be annoying
2 hours is fine though lol
the nina gang gang
<a:monkaShoot:699841146943176734>
i enjoy driving
so it doesnt feel like much
im in the middle so everything is great
traffic is just annoying but whatever
üôÇ
maybe its cause im always driving down alone
30 mins to SD to an hr to santa ana
im right above sd so
ur not close to 626 jenny
or driving up alone
i dont go to LA
fuck LA
driving is fun with you drive a smooth sedan
everything north of me is "far" by most people's standards
<:aha:612044524927057921>
with POWER
but i dont rly care
or a MARO
yessir
i dont even mean la i mean like sgv
ehh like a drive to the beach from me is already 30 minutes
and i don't ever do that
Eww SGV
beach from me is legit like 5 minutes
maybe not even
must be nice
too bad im not much of a beach person
lul
i prefer the mountains
so i hardly ever go üòÇ
imagine living in the snow
couldnt be me
i want to go to the mountains to snowboard too
could DEFINITELY be me
snow goat
or i could learn to surf
snowboarding > surfing
hmmm
anyday of the week
moutains > beach
i never done sufring so i wouldn't know
or just be a lazy piece of shit like me
im in a literal surfer town
yet i never surf
and i go to the beach only every so often
i like it, but it's not my preference you know
yeah i completely understand that
hmm i guess im more of a city person
i like the cities too
but it depends on which ones
i hate LA with a passion
but love places like SF, NY, Tokyo, Berlin
etc
la drivers can burn
^
whole hearted facts
thats the only place where i legitmately hate driving
the place is a cesspool
and the road infrastructure makes no sense
it's literal GARBO
... and then of course, there's the drivers
lul
wait but people in SF are worse at driving
I also hate SD for driving
no fun
ok but do sf roads make no sense
but the roads arent as shitty
roads in LA make no fucking sense
in the downtown
its all one ways
gotta learn how to deal with it
or just never go to LA like me lol
no just that, but it can be really easy to end up on the wrong side of the road
cause like fuck driving in LA
with how they designed them
at night
when u cant see as well
the place is literally dangerous
in la its like u either go diagonal  left or diagonal right and one of them is considered straight???
even people from LA don't like driving in LA
no one likes LA
Tourists love it what do you mean
and dont even get me started about the parking
LUL
tourists dont know shit
they only like it on paper cuz of the media
they dont know what it really is
so they dont count
no local even really cares about LA or anything it has to offer,
no city spirit
lul
<:ppkek:552775140740431875>
SAC GOAT
i mean other than clubs and staples center theres really nothing you need to go into LA for
mhmm
or like if youre going to a convention
and u can find good clubs many other places too
and yeah, conventions too
mmmmm yeah i guess
but that doesnt make LA good
it just has good events cuz it's LA
but like youre not going way out of your way to go to a club
yeah
for sure
Im not even saying LA is good
hello and welcome ario!!
I barely go there unless I have to lol
fellow marshall student :3
yo thank u steph
leave steph
yessir
im kidding i love u
oh..
mg!snap <@!303002872646467596>
_wait_
well
I'd much rather stick to the suburbs and look for cool local things
<a:pepeLaugh:585596844839796736>
imma be living there in the fall
im back bitch
oh welcome back lol
cuz traffic heading into sd from OC
AHAHA
is AIDS
hi back bitch im ur sisters mom
no thank u
oh im well aware
mhmm
imma be real
also yes oc -> sd is terrible
i just chose marshall on my application
cuz the name sounded cool
Its just irvine that makes it shitty
lul
i didnt even look into it
oc to sd rn is actually kinda okay
like you'll be smooth sailing then boom irvine traffic
bc rona killed traffic
but i looked into it afterwards and was releived that it was good
marshall one of the easier colleges
as far as the classes they make u take
^
mhmm
i was glad i didnt pick revelle
sixth best college for easy lowest amount of ge's
after what i read
lmao
hi
üòÇ
hey you did your research congrats lmao
^^ better than me
unlike the rest of us in revelle
i did it after the fact
but got lucky
that mashall was an easier oone
just read the small blurb that they put out and be like oh cool
i just picked it cuz the name was cool, location seemed good, and the building looked cool when i looked it up
thats basically i
Im just glad that i met a good group of people in revelle
but i feel like it's far from tata hall where the bio classes are
so that might be an L
so thats true
who knows what would have happened if i was in a differnt college
wait do marshall transfers have to take doc
but hey, more exercise
also the walk to tata is like 10 min so ur good
i think htey have to take like one class of it?
from marshall
ok not bad
10 minutes revelle to erc if you walk fast enogh
_no one walks that fast_
i've done it
also is parking good if u have a permit?
cuz im gonna have to park my car
nope
at le school
its bad if eeven with a permit
well u see theyre supposedly adding back more parking with the new college
worse now that they ripped up all the parking
however dont know how much its gonna help
since im gonna live at the school, i guess i dont need to drive much
so i can just leave it in whatever spot it is
yeah, its good for when youre off campus
but whenever i do drive finding another spot gonna be annoying i guess
oh well
its hard, because people literally swoop the spot as soon as its open
thats how it's like at community college too
so it's whatever
no i mean even living on campus
people are vultures in those lots, man
at night too
i get you
but oh well
is the parking like in front of the dorm?
or do i have to park in that big parking structure
umm marshal has a structure
OH BET
LET'S GO
but like only the bottom 2 floors have parking i think
imma have to scavenge
roam around like a shark looking for its prey
looking for a spot
yee, some people literally park their car across campus just to get a spot
a lot park at triton ball park but thats literally on the opposite end of campus
that shit be mad lame
i knew a marshall transfer who was taking doc <@!345083648124649485>
i dont want to park outside
my car gonna get messed up that way
yeah i think marshall transfers still have to take at least one or 2
i always keep it garaged, so i dont want all that heat
and crap
ew
24/7
and idk what doc is
writing course
but i'll take whatever i have to
ah
that aint a problem
writing is ez
...
oh hunny
literally never had a problem with any course outside of STEM
compared to STEM classes, i dont find writing courses difficult at all
at any level
that ive taken
so no worries
props to ya!

Abgs don't call themselves abg
imagine labeling someone a cholo/chola
<@!345083648124649485> : AnOTheR One BIteS The DuSt
They just murder you
Yes sandy
bc of how they dress, thtsWACK
and not until I met Nina did I know the REAL definition of an ABG
ohp
tell me
I thought I described what a real abg was
wat isthe real definition of abg
and thts how ppl use the abg term nowadays
At one point
there is no respecr given
brb sandy pulling it up
LOLLL okie
Ngl though. People using the abg term loosely low-key made me forget what a real abg was
tbh kids in my area throw it around bc..... we dont have any actual abgs in our area LMAOOOO

ucsd got a lotta azns so it be nice
anaheim hills...... definitely..... interesting......

thERE SI NOTHING HERE
wheres anaheim hills?
also wauw i did not know abg was historically rooted <@!286708165612011531> ty ninu
is it just beyond anaheim?
Near anaheim
Oh right now I remember
it is technically anaheim
What I was going to say
east anaheim
ye! it's a cultural thing for sure, if ppl weren't a part of tht lifestyle or if they didn't live in oc, they dunno
closer to yorba linda / corona
ohh yorba area
I wish I connected with my latinx peeps more at school but idk I just haven't connected
> ye! it's a cultural thing for sure, if ppl weren't a part of tht lifestyle or if they didn't live in oc, they dunno
<@!286708165612011531> yas yas ty we love being educated ~~
There are people out there that get upset on abg gatekeeping. But it's the truth. 
You can't change that.
def were east azn and other se azn abgs besides viet ones but viet were hella prevalent
lol sandy drive into gg/westminster/fv and youll meet a lot of us
Like I remember some girl on Sat spoke the truth about abgs and the comments were nasty. Because they were offended people
The truth being most abgs aren't abgs
or she can drive to SD and meet all of us
when school starts :)
> lol sandy drive into gg/westminster/fv and youll meet a lot of us

Hi steph
stoof is like
have u ever played hs club vball
hello everyone
"volleyball"
"yes"
i played club + hs
i meant like precollegiate club so perfect
so college club is really similar
tryout in fall (hopefully this will happen), season is all of winter qtr
club dues are about 700 i think?
dragon boat
they'll probably let volleyball happen again if they find a way to sanitize the ball right away everytime someone hits it
<a:hahakek:676470025317777484>
and that covers hotel and tourney fees
a tryout oh shit
i am rusty as hell
<:scream:688600057616007190>
just dont be rusty
we have tourneys maybe every other week or so
lmao arent we all

yeah understandable, we've had to move our treadmill or fold it up sometimes bc not enough room
theyre just expensive dawg

med school <:Pepe_MonkaChrist:612363181318209562>
yeah i want to be a neurologist
wauw
lol most bio ppl i know are neuro ppl
ive only seen like 2 neuro people in this chat
idk if i want to go premed just yet so for now it‚Äôs pre PA
LOL
unless i change my major to marine bio and do a 360
<a:ohohoho:636686946734964786>
marine bio is cool
marine bio minor
There are no neuroscience kiddos here.
i kinda want to minor in cog sci
just cuz
thats a flex
the counselor suggested it to me and it seemed like a good idea
I minored in psychology after switching from clinical.
yeah i was also considering the marine science minor
i dont think id have to do much extra work for a cog sci minor
When you have your minor before your major <a:sadshaky:670539217905909770>
from what i saw
would be nice
but depends on what i can squeeze in to still graduate in 2022
i dont want to go over if i can avoid it
Who else are premedical buddies on here?
me
i think
LOL
dope
depends on my willpower
Switch to neuroscience. Come to the dark si-
and whether i actually want to commit to that many years in med school
i definitely want to go to med school
You can learn about cool stuff. Like neuroscience.
and neurons
i just want grad school
And science!
and then im done
med school is scary
the scientific method
thats my favorite part
can i just take a neuroscience class
LOL
My health is too poor for medical school.
LOL
me
I recommend BIPN 160.
Neuroanatomy
ok bet
all this fucking coursework so far as been everything but
ANATOMY
neuroscience
LUL
o-chem
PHYSIOOOOLOGYYYY
gen bio
calc
It‚Äôs a bit challenging though.
WHERE IS THE NEURO!????????
F
i didnt think i was a chem major
i wish there was a physio major tho
there isnt?
The neuroscience comes when you get good(tm)
There was.
Physiology and Neuroscience
heart breaking
You‚Äôre about two years too late
I WOULD LOVE THAT
<:pain2:706947574732423188>
i know davis has physio
It‚Äôs just neurobiology now.
being born in 2000 is a satisfying year
i didnt apply to ucd xD
Yeah when you‚Äôre old and senile you won‚Äôt forget your name
We used to have physio
davis calls it neurobiology, physiology and behavior
I mean age o
and u can choose a route
and one of them is physio
ucsb has physio too
that might have been more your cup of tea
Virgin physio versus chad Neurobio

That the appendix is essentially useless
no u
i think something that really surprised me that the butt is actually three muscles and not just one LMAOOOO
matt's an appendix basically
I am useless thanks for noticing
<:cursedab:640362029609385995>
matt
The butt is what now
have u ever owned a samsung galaxy
and if so
Yes
S6 edge plus
how do they shape up to the pixel
o
Slow
Er
i wanna either get a galaxy note or pixel soon
They're just fancy bodies
gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, and gluteus minimus
time to work out all three bad boys for a bigger booty
New note is coming soon. Same with pixel a month later
yee
Obviously pixel is cheaper
I think one of my favs is that when there‚Äôs no light or little light
The only thing is Samsung devices probably have much better battery life. Hopefully the 5th pixel fixes that and if it does
I'll buy it
<:feelsweirdman:671659510317711390>

lbut like
apparently ternansky is really difficult, so i dont want to take him
if i can avoid it
but again
need more options
to weigh against
I swear if it‚Äôs phineas gage
But yes Nick. The overall used experience is very very good on pixel
that thing where ur left and right eye are like switched and you can only like say a picture out loud on one side and draw a pic on the other side
oh yes
i just want a laid back o-chem prof that doesnt make the subject harder than it already is
idk ppl abt psych i self studied i could‚Äôve cared less abt the ppl CHSINFS
OH
i dont want some hardass psycho that kills students with ridiculously difficult shit
PHINEAS GAGE

Hello sir I am awake with you as well

ANYWAY GOOD MORNING
Good morning all welcome to the end!
good morning gamerrzzz
> Good morning all welcome to the end!
<@!213151486434082817> this sounded ominous
but ya mornin cuties!
Good morning ‚òÄÔ∏è
Ehh end of week 9, or the world take it as you please lol
we in the home stretchh
so stonks
weclome to the club!
i know how to type properly
welcome!
<:cacodemon:713483943969554483>
but wait tomer, have you been investing in stonks?
welcome welcome
nop
i don't know where to look for advice in this lol
I know some things cus my dad did/does
yeah its kinda meh
ahh i see isee
hello welcome :3
tldr index is pretty safe when the economy is stable
but if you want quick profits
you'd have to research and do like
day trading
cus it doesnt really yield that much if you just plop everything into dow
yeah im not looking for anything quick quick
well depends how much you have also but yeah
yeah
yearly quick is a thing though lol
I would say go safe over profit
or by the quarter
cus at the end of the day, it is very easy to lose tons of money too
exactly
The thing with day trading is that its just educated gambling
yeah
at least imo
I wouldnt tell you to do that
cus one its a lotta work
and its never guaranteed
like you can have all the DD and shit like that and it can still turn out super bad
ye
same with options, cause youre either betting on the company to gain a lot by said time
less of a risk though if youre doing proper research
but also, this isnt really an opportune time to get into stocks; what with the whole global pandemic and halt of manufacturing
i mean investments in health and tech can yeild a lot
true
imagine if you bought zoom stocks 3 months ago
whew
I have a lot of missed moments, where I was putting in money on things based on a hunch
welcome <@!397981106370117643>  !
like there was this one called docusign, a company that does pdf signing, trading at $40 when it became public now at 120
this was a couple years ago, but like if i had money then to just keep it in ugh
dam
Welcome!! <:banzai:442185100273123328>
welcome welcome
Docusign
I‚Äôve heard of that
also another business that was super shady, but gained like 1100% in a week and i sold when they stated dropping
ooh ever used it?
it's a pretty big company now, lots of ppl use it to sign forms/agreements
I think they have internships <:kek:490008924414803968>
yeah i used it a couple times to sign NDAs or send out contracts
super convienient tbh
Yuh
I think I had to sign a waiver and somebody was like just use this
What are peoples plans for today?
code
and then more coding
short break of league
then more coding
tell myself im gonna do work but then not
also a mood
but we pray for you henry
I just remembered I had a mandatory discussion today
And then a meeting
And then homework until I die
im, just here wallowing in the fact that im procrastinating
I really need to fix my sleep schedule
Like I‚Äôm getting my 8 hrs but it‚Äôs just kinda yikes. It‚Äôs 4 am - 12 pm everyday
I mean
as long as you're not missing anything important
I dont see why having that sleep schedule is bad other than the fact that society deems it "bad"
because its associated with gamers that are lazy
we lib in a society
<:pepehands:464568955533524992>
But yea, I don't think "fixing your sleep schedule" is necessary unless you're sleeping through classes or missing important stuff
ha...ha....
or or or just take like 20 naps throughout the day lol
scientifically speaking ur sleep schedule is best aligned with the day night cycle iirc
or at least a consistent one
it‚Äôs a good feeling to be up and seeing the sun just rising
ye my parents would just prefer a 12am-8am sleep schedule
and its prob best
for my actual schedule
of classes and stuff
but i just sleep through my classes <:kek:490008924414803968>
me too jenny
i have a 3 am 12 pm sched rn lol
XD
my mom
walks in every day
and looks at my disappointedly
üôÇ
I mean at least you get 8 hours Jenny lol
ye
i used to get like 4
ngl
Ohp
saaaaaaaame
See small victories lol
bc stress and nightmares
Oh no
bc school yeet
winter quarter i slept so little holy shite
it was a very stressful times, issok ive gotten past it mostly
Ehh I mean it‚Äôs better than mine where I sleep around 2-3 ish and wake up around 6-8 ish
üò¢
It‚Äôs okie I take a lot of mental breaks through out the day to just be a potato
üëç
naps
I don‚Äôt even nap lol
Well sometimes
Well sometimes
But like right now I‚Äôm just laying in bed
nice nice
oml 96.25 gb for warzone D:
Not worth
<:PEPESCREAM:466446495747670027>

gm gamers
good morning jef
randy do you ever play
aim lab
HELLLO FRIENDS
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ9ZdjvNVA
THE COVER IS HERE!!!!!
ok i see u litto üòª
ummm i don't do aim lab or kovak's, a lot of people do
> THE COVER IS HERE!!!!!
<@!242544930528952321> 
OKAY OKAAAAY
I main jsut use aim bots and free for all dm
<@!144994874570047488>
but umm thats not really a thing in valorant
<@!144994874570047488> what do u need aim lab for tho <:Thonk:264701195573133315>
nothin
its just fun x)
.-.
osu!
kekeke
i mean
its free so
yeah i hear its just a worse kovakks
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm going to do randy
I‚Äôm going to start learning osu! For aim practice kek
But also helps with reaction time
lol i don't use it for aim prac, but if its for just learning to click dots then go for it kekeke
i mean i feel like osu would be more memorization no?
site reading is all reaction
yea but thats assuming you're only playing every map once
turn on hidden?
i mean if you play a bunch of maps and never really go back to the same one too often its not really ever memorized
That‚Äôs me
That‚Äôs what I was doing in clone hero anyways
And pump it up lol
for me reaction time isn't really something i can work on in game
Kinda have to be doing sports or being active irl to help speed up your reaction time
or quick boost to it that doesn't last, caffeine
Yeah. I heard exercising improves brain so you have faster reaction time because brain healthy
my average reaction time when I was still more physically active was around 170 ms, now its around 200 ms lolol
but this is through different sites and in game clients
i think most pros are around 140 ms?
> THE COVER IS HERE!!!!!

extra legs

<:shook:606018427018149889>
my thought process is a large atonks
if u turned into a spider .... your power over humans would be astronomical

time to snatch lara
we're getting u outta there
<:bulbaowo:615441070033207307>
my house is just
conservative asians
yikes
and u kno where it goes from there <:zoop:435223493311725573>
my parents would get along with yours then
i just have like drastically differing opinions w my dad so it is very tense
same
hmm i feel like they aren't as hardcore as yours
my parents are hardcore Catholics and republicans
they're not as condemning towards homosexuality as yours are but i know they think it's weird or something
luckily i was raised in a more chill religion ewfuboiwebsdv
My parents pray the rosary everyday and have meetings for their church group
And watch a bunch of videos
ohp <:POGGERS:699392343920476223>
wait
Yes
what is praying the rosary
Oh uhh
You pray the same prayers for like 20 minutes
i came out to my mom and she was upset and then i asked her months later if it was ok if i brought a girl home
It‚Äôs tiring because I hate repeating myself
and she laughed and went "what a funny joke, if you do i might get a heart attack" so tht was the end of it
i-
it's ok but like not ok?
ykno?
yeah i feel like
sometimes u just. don't argue with a Viet Mom
viets arent like outspoken but it's like they think its weird
u right
Oh <:FeelsBadMan:441463646124507136>
i think
My parents didn‚Äôt want me to date anyone regardless
when it comes to asian parents, you need to ease them into any kind of potentially shocking news if possible but ultimately, it's not our job to try to make tht ultimately comfortable for them
u right
Yes
and them being "older" and "ignorant" shouldn't ever be an excuse to not educate, but sometimes u just gotta conserve ya energie
she's important!
you give off the same vibes as my other cousin
she is constantly telling me to educate my parents LOL
it's p impt! but then like sometimes im like ah shit im talking to a wall
yeah ik thats the thing i have problems w hefjbd
i forgot the terms but my dad likes to use many argumentative tactics to get around my point and do a loop as to why ... he's right <:feelsbadman:584486296097914911>
I find it hard to talk to my parents <:pepehands:464568955533524992>
Because I have big anxiety <:peepocry:640363747990306827>
<:PeepoCry:694447846056787998>
it seems like i can talk to lara's parents more than lara can

<:pepehmm:671658873526157323>
oh i mean with violin i understand, because its a lot easier to control since you have better control over the instrument
but with like a trumpet on trombone theres so much leverage and its easy for it to bounce out
Like from my own experience marching even in a straight line is hard
hmmmm i drank a bit, but i don't even feel it
:0
how many shots <:monkaS:442185930867081218>
bold of you to assume its shots
randy on his 2nd handle: *huh?*

<a:sheepglasses:690065424259219470>
tht amt would have be sprawled backwards over the arm of a loveseat

onetime my cousin had open bar at his wedding and we were having drinks all night lol
but like lets say like 15 shots?
idk i haven't counted lol

<@!493178993814798346>
it's a card game where you guess either the number, suit, or color
each time you get it wrong you drink
each time you get it wrong you drink
and they have an extra little thing at the end where you can give shots to your friends

woo spacex launch today
Eh i dont like Musk or SpaceX lmao
Sketchy ass man with sketchy ass company
thats fine, but think of it this way. Our own government isn't trying to do anyhting with space anymore
and its one of the few launches that we'll probably have as part of our generation
True, but not exactly NASA‚Äôs fault
i never said it was nasa's fault now did i?
I said our government wasn't trying to do it
NASA is severely underfunded and our government prioritizes military spending over research
NASA is severely underfunded and our government prioritizes military spending over research
Oh true
But honestly its really sad
yeah, but im not trying to get into the politics of it. just taking in the moment
i dont think there's enough motivation for our govt to put money into space development anyways
since the space industry has already been privatized
yeah, so like I think its fine if you don't like musk or his company, but having someone fund space exploration and things of the sort is what I find good
Yea
I mean the whole "comercialize" space is iffy
but like we need to be able to get there before we can debate that issue lol
good morning again to everyone just waking up
good morning gamers!!
i just dreamed that i was on a ship that was about to capsize bc of really large waves so i, along with others, had to hold a kid to my chest as well as a railing at the same time
shit was traumatizing
omg
Should I try champagne
<:isathonk:657297620540194836>
everyone watch the launch :0 T-15 mins ish
t-4 minutes
t-2 mins
> Should I try champagne
<@!245736329382461440> yes, bubbly alc!
Yes champagne is where it‚Äôs at
LAUNCHHHH
wooooo
LAJKSHFDIWUEHFLKAJSDF
ship has gone brrr
look at that ploom
whew
rocket has gone BRRR
iirc, it's a 9 min flight to orbit???
I wanna see them land
the first stage
oof
only the first stage
tomer i thought they were just gonna recall th
well Idk if the seond stage is recoverable
stage two go BRRRRR
<@!324701936593141760> i only know know all of these rocket terms bc of that seminar thing you made me go to
n o m i n a l = good
Something something _nominal trajectory_
Damn we‚Äôre almost at a point where we can say it was successful
rockets are cool
What makes me pretty sad is that people are still going to say this is fake
:((((
OH SHIT
falcon 9 actually landed
stage one landedd
POGGG
They made it
camera cut out on landing
big gsad
haha their ‚ÄúI still love you‚Äù
yeah
hahaha
Aww it‚Äôs so cool
wait there was a little dinosaur thingy D:
His souvineer from home
awwwww
wait where was the dinosuar?
dragon separation confirmed
lmao they are doing like
"thanks for choosing united"
YEAH
Omg 19 hours
delta airlines bois
bumpy ass ride
thanks for choosing spacex dragon, hope to see you again next time
pulled > 2.3 G but thats ok
Rip stage 2
stage 2 never lands xD
They should have it burn up
space junk
nah
is that thing just floating in space now
Yeah
F
p much lmao
thats the trunk right
We have a lot of trash in space
the trunk?
Yeah they lost the boot
Kekeke
LMFAO
we have a lot of trash on earth too üôä
19 hours in that little capsule
Rip all their food
holy moly
wait
19 hours???
thats insane
Sad that I‚Äôm part of that trash
why didnt they just
THEY TOOK OFF HELMETS
no, me <@!213151486434082817> üò†
HAHAHAHA
rocket the rocket into the ISS
And yeah they have to wait for the ISS to meet them
what
the iss is orbiting
that would be hard to hit
bruh they think the astronauts can sleep
????
AHHAHAHAHA
Like they are basically on a collision course with it
instead they match the orbit
yeah
i know
that would be funny
if they just
insta dock with the ISS
nYOOM
We need the space elevator now
crashes into iss
takes out the entire station
This is just the beginning
yeeeee
i think we needed this
at least one thing good has happened
The one piece of good news in this shithole of a year
they are really emphasizing american american american
<@!493178993814798346> my sentiments exactly
and yeha
theyre like
ALL AMERICAN
AMERICAN ROCKET
I mean yeah this is a really patriot thing
AMERICAN ASTRONAUTS
as if the soyuz rockets havent been successfully for ages
oop
lmfao
Yeah but I think it‚Äôs the fact that more nations are becoming space faring again
nah i mean
us aastronauts would just get launched using soyuz rockets
space exploration is still a pretty collaborative thing
Oh yeah, idk I guess they are like it feels good that we‚Äôre able to produce our own as well again
ISS is like a buncho nations
yeah for sure
Damn those suits look so good though lol
but like, they are overly politicizing it when imo its mostly all spaceX's doing
You‚Äôre right, though
brrrr
next up
Artemis
les go
Ooh
i think elon's net worth just increased
Tesla and space x about to shoot up in price again
hmmm
"i was praying"
I think falure rate was like
.2 %
Hmm that‚Äôs pretty good lol
yeah I mean
it only took around 6 months but finally something good happened x
d
Andrew did you end up changing?
the falcon 9 has launched before
yea i sent the request
just the capsule is new
Oh yeah, but like putting up people in space is alaways a thing that you just cross you‚Äôre fingers for even if it‚Äôs a low low low percent
true
yo, whatd yall think about that space launch
very nice
pretty clean
sad we didnt get to see the landing burn
rip ocisly camera
What‚Äôs sad about the previous space failures, at least from what I read in my class this time is that they could have been prevented but bad leadership and a lot of government and social pressure caused them to launch
my mom was confused cuz she found it really weird that it was just a "test" (i didnt know they were going to the ISS so i told her i guessed it was just coming back down)
yeah
If we got to see the landing that would be amazing
you can look up prior missions
oh wat was that falcon thing or watever
where they show the landing feed
that they did show landed afterwards
its super awesome
space failures of spacex, or like early nasa rockets?
Yeah, it looks sick
NASA
Sorry I wasn‚Äôt clear
yee
That was the falcon rocket garret
gotta beat teh reds u know
the stage one falcon 9 is what landed
so they discard stage 2?
But Falcon rockets had failures before but those were all unmanned
Yeah stage 2 is just left up there in space
that was part of the manned rocket they sent up right?
Yeah
my mom was like
ohh they saved stage 1?
they landed??
and stage 2 is abandoned?
already??
Yup
first manned mission with falcon 9
ok thats what i assumed lol
did yall know, the falcon 9 heavy is basically a beefed up version with a buncho previous gen rockets strapped on as boosters?
I find that
peak enginir
first launch in a while in the usa
i think since 2011ish?
yeah
Yeah sounds about right
since the spaceshuttle
space x: hmmm hw do we innovate a new engine to get ppl back into space
also space x: lets just stick a bunch of old rockets together
I remember them bringing the space shuttles to LA and seeing it just fly over my school
the new missions get hand me downs
"old" like 1 year old but yeah
xD
The new engine innovation is the fact that we can bring it back
yes

wait did someone ping me i cant find it
yes in one of the bot lands but its okay it was nothing important
dw sandy it was a stupid bot thing

now yeeted
tl;dr t-slur is still a slur no matter how you try and spin it
*any slur is still a slur no matter how you try and spin it*
there it is !
not like it was also missle ginny stick too or whateva
the only situation I can think of where there's more of a gray area with slurs is when a slur is being reclaimed by the group it targets however how the bot was using it clearly was Not It
Wait, what happened with poke cord?
<@!203407962302185472>
Oof
Holy shit, what?
<:pain:713285895419330591>
Why??
Wasn't really clear, but the developer said it was due to "added work and stress"
He probably got a job somewhere...
We may never really know but I too am saddened by this as Pokecord was something I used daily to pass time and connect with people
Yeah, I have good memories of catching Pokemon with people too. Sad to see it go
aight, now's our chance, we're gonna make the next iteration of pokecord
Yes I do wish the best for the creator
Seems like hes got a lot on his plate
hi yall i posted it in <#453790820886380544> but my org commission on warren spirit is currently playing skribblio and later hopefully jackbox

NP NP we're going until 8!
LA city curfew
8 pm
I mean, it‚Äôs not like people are going out anyways
people are actually
to protest
but anyway bring it to probably current-news
if u have anything to say
just putting this out therr
<@!219584106550263809> not that I know of
Honestly implementing pokecord would take a month max with a team of 3-4 people
Not the worst idea
<:wuh:440237146998046730>
concept
:^)
Bet
good thing we have the waifu bot to wipe away our tears
this is really sad
i have a question
is there extra maintenance you have to constantly do to keep a bot running on discord?
i know some of you guys made bots here
hellir
should human bio take the chem placement test
uhh
i dont think so

<@!286708165612011531> I would be careful about posting stuff about the protests on social media since the fbi can look through your browser history AND your phone  without a warrent (thanks Patriot Act)!
They cant legally unlock a password protected phone BUT they can use your fingerprint and face ID
Plus they can also look into any of your friends/ family
This goes for everyone else too, take necessary precautions and stay safe!
pardon?
Was referring to the fb post lol
Just be careful
???
I would delete anything incriminating in your browser history rn lmao
i
pardon?
I don't think we have anything to hide
if thats what your insinuating
youre*
Thats not the problem tho
wilson imma have to ask you to elaborate furthur
The government can p much use anythibgb against you if they wanted
Why would someone be looking at a bunch of random college students
there's no reason to single us out from the crowd
yes plz use my spotify playlists against me
They arrest hella college stufents and ppl at protests
thats the thing
_at_ protests
AT the protests
And stop them with tear gas
are we out there rn?
no
are we raising awareness for the situation?
yes
social media is still a form of protest tho
Im not saying dont do it
Im saying be careful
The fact that the patriot act even exists disgusts me
if i were to be arrested for looking at protest-related social media, i wouldn't be here anymore lol
Yea but the passing of the patriot act could mean new rules for the internet
https://www.facebook.com/groups/ucsdvsa/?post_id=10157286677599013
wilson the way that you just @ nina specifically was very call-out like. ik you just wanted to say "be careful", but this isn't the way to do it. times like these are very sensitive and sitting back and doing nothing does not help at all
she's bringing awareness to the situation for those that might not be able to be at the protests themselves
Was it? My bad I wasnt trying to call anyone out
She was the only one i saw so thats why i mentioned it
I know you mean well Wilson, but I think you're worrying a bit too much. 
The Patriot Act isn't used against people who aren't already targets anyway...
Ofc i dont mean take it down
If you're undocumented, or have a shaky student visa, or are crossing the US border anytime soon, perhaps be more careful. Otherwise, if you're safe, by all means, spread awareness
there are also literally millions of people on this earth and on social media. the "authorities" arent going to be nitpicking someone's online presence unless they actually had a reason to
she and anyone else that is posting about this is not doing anything wrong. those that may raise concerns are those that are inciting violence, calling for violent riots, etc
its def important to know that your online footprint is trackable, but there are many people who are much more radical posting stuff all over the internet, and nina merely posted about things to keep in mind and the significance of recent events
she has nothing to hide
with all due respect i'm very confused on why my ^^^^post can be used against me in any way when it is a way to inform; i know my rights to freedom of speech and also my consequences. however, i am not inciting any hateful actions or speech. it was a way to educate and compile necessary information for a community that i knew needed a big push in leaning into the discomfort of supporting the black community, which has been leeched from and also besmirched by ppl like me : D
Yea but they still CAN access your history and I think that is very important. The police are handling these protests very poorly and honestly what they are doing is unconstitutional. Im not saying anything WILL happen Im saying anything CAN happen. By all means spread awareness but also take some steps to protect yourself. Thats all im saying.
I worry about ppl thats all
i'll be honest, i've looked up some pretty sketchy stuff sometimes out of curiosity <:kek:490008924414803968>
thanks for worrying but dw those that post informative things know what theyre doing and how to protect themselves
Sometimes I shout stuff about drone bombs and the White House near my smart speaker just to piss my FBI agent off
Nothing happens
privacy is spooky
<@!286708165612011531> your freedom of speech is VERY IMPORTANT so we have to let these jackasses know that we wont step down. They will do everything they can to stop these protests without real change so by mentioning these injustices you already stick out from the crowd. Yknow what i mean?
I remember reading an article about these reporters that went to talk to snowden and he had them put all devices with an antennae in the freezer to block any possible signals
sometimes i wish my fbi agent would reach out to me and ask if i was okay ü•∫ üëâ üëà
lmao she's not the only one doing it wilson
Remember the Panama Papers? Whistleblower got MURDERED
I know
But shes my friend
And i want her to be safe
I tell this to all my friends btw im not singling you out
i appreciate the words of caution but in this case i have been a vessel of information and any calls to action, as yall can read in the link above, is DIRECTLY connected to what the azn community can do to unlearn their personal biases, and re-educate themselves and their loved ones. i genuinely do not know why the govt would target a 5'4 viet hooligan bitch who posted in a social/cultural org's community page to educate other ppl abt what they can do to help black ppl from being slaughtered but ya
"5'4 viet hooligan bitch" omg
u forgot ur üëë  queen
tea served biggo ugh your mind
so powerful
she's a ninagan
Its because the Trump Administration knows the people are not happy with the government. Just remember our country is rum by old powerful rich ppl
DONT TAKE YOUR RIGHTS FOR GRANTED FIGHT FOR THEM
wilson... that's what she's doing...
???????????
wait
alsjkdhflakuwhfkajsfd
that's literally-
Yes
Just do it SAFE
i cannot right now
Thats what i was gonna end with
> tea served biggo ugh your mind
<@!242544930528952321> i adore u litto
i don't get why this isn't safe lol

how much safer can i get
Generally I have a VPN
Encrypts my data
wilson its
Id start with that
not that serious
^^
its a valid concern
but TRULY
it is NOT that serious
it really . is not that serious
i don't see any reason why u'd use a vpn to raise awareness xd
ur not doing anything illegal either ? ur just speaking up

no
how it goes matt
How is it not serious that the fbi can access your info whenever they want?
It is serious. But none of us are at risk right now.
^^
nina is not at risk either
her post
which is why we use our voices to protect those who are
was informative and barely mentioned her personal opinions
no one is at risk unless they're actually advocating for violence that is punishable
<a:monkaCough:713632323995959376>

damn
just getting to the chorus
the good part boiii
but ok
ill stop
You‚Äôre no all star, Wilson
lmao
but i am
jkjk im a fucking king
that songs stuck in my head now lmao
i used to know the whole song at some point i think
idk if i still do tho
damn i used to just like spend my time memorizing meme songs
what did i do with my life lmao
and like watch anime
my weeb phase was hella bad
like i was like full on weeb
like anime merch like everything
i remember there was like this one anime kiosk that opened in our mall
and when i heard i was like ooooooh shit
but like everything there was hella expensive
so i was like helllll naw
but tbh i feel
that if i had the money
i wouldve like bought out their entire stack
stock*
you feel?
thats not even like where it ends tho
i watched like soo much anime
like i watched like the deep shit yknow
the shit that like no one really knows about
like the shit that doesnt even have like proper subs
and you gotta like get a scanlation/ sub from some sketchy person in china or smnh
but yea obvi i got bullied a lot for being a weeb lmao
but like honestly tho
i feel like because i was bullied
i watched more anime
bc it was like an escape ya feel?
like especially a lot of like romance animes
bc i wanted a gf
and i was in like middle school lmao
so id like watch hella shoujo and harem shit
and like read too obvi
and i was like damn
i wish i was popular
but at least im popular in the anime world jkjk
like not even lol
it would be cool if they made like an anime about me tho
idk what itd be about
but i have pondered the thought like a lot
i feel like my life aint interesting enough to have an anime made about me  tho
oh i watched a lot of like isekai too
bc like literal escapism lmaooo
but yea after like sophomore year i kinda grew out of my anime phase
and into my idk wtf im doing phase
where im literally unsure about everything
also lmao senior year was also the time i was diagnosed with adhd
so like i had it my whole life and i didnt even know it apparently?
or maybe i didnt and the doc is wack who knows
but i always wonder if i like actually have adhd
or if tje doctor was just wack
but then i was like
if i did or didnt its not like id have anything to compare to
since i wouldnt know how "normal" ppl thought
but like i kinda feel like i prob do
bc i get distracted a lot
and i also go on tangents sometimes
like if you ask me about something i like to talk about
i will literally go on like forever
like ill p much keep talking for a while
but i feel like thats prob annoying
since i dont want to like hog the convo
but i also just get like so into it yknow?
that sometimes i dont even realize im doing it
but like i try to limit myself
and contain my excitement
so to speak i guess
but yea that was a p jarring discovery lol
I've done the same thing before. I always worry now that I talk too much...
sometimes I just want to hear the other person say something and they don't even realize it
lmao riight?
also jfc i typed a lot
yea i just get way too into my mind lol
and forgot
that i have a midterm due in a few hours holy shit
good luck!
holy fuck its also week 10
thank you!
no week 10 starts on Monday :P
u right
plus its not tomorrow until i sleep
mood
uhhh oh also about the patriot act thing
just want to clear some points up before i leave:
1. Yes you may not be doing anything illegal but at this point the govnt might make up some bs excuse to incriminate you
2. just stay safe
thats all
thanks folks
don't think thats gonna happen, the general public is gonna have too big of a freedom boner to let that happen
thats what i thought too but the fact that the new bill passed make me very very wary
govt is sketchyyyyyyy af
which one?
the one that allowed the fbi to look at browser history and stuff
just passed like i want to say last month??
das a yikes and i think your concerns are valid
however, if no one is being suuper radical or getting in anyones face directly, i highly doubt the fbi can monitor every single american
the probability of being.. investigated? is not zero but it is very close to zero
did I mention my fortnut drone bomb
LMAO
https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/6172/text
yall can read bout it if you want
as long as you know thats good
everything else is up to you
Update, May 14: The Patriot Act reauthorization bill passed the Senate on Thursday, without the Wyden-Daines amendment (but with an amendment from Sens. Leahy and Lee that added some independent oversight to the FISA court). The vote was 80-16. Murray, now back in DC, was among the no votes

wdym? Vox is usually pretty trustworthy in my experience
yea but still a secondary source
so prone to bias
true
but yea vox is p good about their sources and stuff
<:thonk:440231969796784128>
Oh we are reading about the Patriot Act
That was always gonna happen
to repeal the Patriot Act would take insurrection
FREEDOM Act is just Obamas version
Which includes some nice provisions
I don't remember if FREEDOM was the bill that included the provision allowing Drone killings of US Citizens
Or if that was one of the other smaller bills
Thanks Obama
Taking our liberties away epic gamer style
More like thanks political institution that indoctrinates everyone who touches it
;-;
Theres always core stuff that no politician will change
Thanks Dianne Feinstein
Its ok guys they aren't voting on FISA (even though technically most of it exists via other bills anyway)
<a:ohohoho:636686946734964786>
Oh and of course its a nice coverup for the other surveillance bills they were totally willing to try and pass
Though I can't talk my country is as bad, its just more honest about it
where are you from?

school does not allow me to do that
i've only ate dinner for the past 4 days
<:thonK:500668461501120525>
but I feel fine
Yum
<:yeet:442868651792793601>  you're not lurking
I mean
At least you're eating
true
It would be worse if you said you only ate a dinner in the past 4 days
<:xd:612726759846051861>
I mean its comparable to one of my regular meals <:xd:612726759846051861>
<:aha:612044524927057921>
Wtf
If you guys go on snapchat and go to the snapmap look at la mesa
yeah I heard about the vons
I think James posted it in <#687107060961378331>
wildin
yeah its p insane
i definitely feel like its gone too far
usually that warrants more change, but I can't really say much
at this point these ppl arent tryna send a message but trying to bring home a 50inch tv
really now, walmart and vons being the targets
not necessarily everyone but yes there will always be that group of people
no matter what
people will always take advantage of events
yeah thats true
and its sad to see
The people who are breaking shit just to break shit and looting for no reason are not actual legitimate protesters
^
I feel like there are people there to incite violence and to demean what should be peaceful protests
But goodmorning to everyone on this last day of may in the year of 2020ay
It‚Äôs almost June wtf
This year so far was a shitshow
Wtf they burned down a chase bank <:monkaS:442185930867081218>
Scrolling through twitter literally got me crying
Someone I know was in la mesa taking videos
they got the MTG card shop
that'll show the police
Personally, I think if you use a mans death as an excuse to steal a TV its pretty disgusting
wait where *is* la meda
like east
it's close to sdsu
if you know where that is
They should‚Äôve left small businesses alone :/
ikr
Damn maybe if the police weren‚Äôt disrupting peaceful protests by firing rubber bullets in full riot gear they‚Äôd be able to do something about it huh
ohh
It‚Äôs almost counterproductive for small businesses specifically though
Especially black owned businesses that have already suffered as a result of covid19
Something tells me that the people who are likely not protesters that are going for those shops anyway never actually cared for the cause nor small businesses in the first place
Yeah true
Also places where the police responded peacefully have actually kept the protests peaceful
Imagine that <:wotthink:441465363671154698>
D:
it‚Äôs hard to characterize the affiliation or reasoning of who did what but we can all agree that looting and striking small businesses aint it? Regardless of who did it
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
Any looting is bad period
And I support those standing their ground where they can
There‚Äôs a real good reason for people to protest, other places have shown it can be peaceful
"The mystifying ideological claim that looting is violent and non-political is one that has been carefully produced by the ruling class because it is precisely the violent maintenance of property which is both the basis and end of their power. Looting is extremely dangerous to the rich (and most white people) because it reveals, with an immediacy that has to be moralized away, that the idea of private property is just that: an idea, a tenuous and contingent structure of consent, backed up by the lethal force of the state. When rioters take territory and loot, they are revealing precisely how, in a space without cops, property relations can be destroyed and things can be had for free."
https://thenewinquiry.com/in-defense-of-looting/
just some food for thought
Yeah I can never ever get behind that. The law is the law <:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
That‚Äôs just my opinion though
oki
Mm I agree that the law should be obeyed but the law is just rules made by the oppressors dontcha think
And when the laws don‚Äôt define justice u need reform
No, laws exist in all countries
And when the oppressors don‚Äôt respond to peace
Well
:/
You can protest, you can speak
It works in other areas
That hasn‚Äôt done anything here
For years
Don‚Äôt deface the name of someone who died
Yeah and there is oppression in like all countries lmao?
And bring attention away from the actual cause
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
Slavery was law before
You realize that right
The police department that killed that man were pieces of shit, but nobody cared when they killed foreigners
And they killed more than one
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
It‚Äôs not just one person, it‚Äôs not just one act of violence, it‚Äôs literally hundreds of years of systematic racism.
This isn‚Äôt just for George Floyd anymore
I‚Äôm sorry but I just cannot ever get behind violence.
No one believes hurting small business is right
It‚Äôs for racism in general
It‚Äôs starting to become more than that
A fight against general racism with George Floyd at its core
The violence is only started when agitators are introduced, and when a people are never heard
Peaceful protests started at taking a knee and people didn't like that either so
I‚Äôm more of a pacifist myself but there‚Äôs things you can‚Äôt solve with peace
Outside agitators sure are a big part of this
Even foreign nations
But, that‚Äôs for the national intelligence to deal with
But when the agitators are white supremacists and opportunists who are the ones made to look bad?
it took almost a century for women to have the right to vote. We are fighting an uphill battle so it‚Äôll definitely take some time.
Thankfully piblic opinion is shifting tho
All I want to say Sam is that violence wasn‚Äôt the first answer and breaking and looting wasn‚Äôt brought in by the peaceful protestors
Pretty quickly too with internet
It took a war to get rights and independence for the colonies and then another to get rid of slavery
The biggest changes and reform unfortunately was brought by violence
Thats true
I think looting in the name of a man who was killed is very disgusting
But whats the specific reform we are looking for rn
There were peaceful attempted made in both situations
If its just to end racism then a war wont do that
To start, police departments can‚Äôt investigate themselves
It‚Äôs just dumb
Its ok guys the boomers who run the country are dying
We are literally living in another civil rights movement, not to gain the rights but to protect and to have the rights of black people and all people of color their rights to actually be enforced and protected
Well get our chance
Start early start often :^)
Okay just wanted to make sure we are all on the same page
Carry on
YEN NO
that's PA forbidden speech
What
> Start early start often :^)
<@!245736329382461440>  these are true threats
What sucks is that saying the boomers are dying isn‚Äôt really what the problem is, it‚Äôs not just the older generation it‚Äôs people being taught and brought up in a racist system
Thats true
Although I do love a revolution, some times violence does makes things worse
No one is ever born racist
Gm gamers
Actually even before the police department thing
You learn the patriarchy
gm yall im at the hb protest rn
<:wuh:440237146998046730>
> The biggest changes and reform unfortunately was brought by violence
<@!186009830484344843> gonna second this one ya
stay safe dino
they called in a whole squadron and a chopper
Convict all four people that were a part of George‚Äôs murder
Stay safe <@!493178993814798346>
That‚Äôs the start
<@!493178993814798346> pls tell me you have a burner phone
Don‚Äôt get hurt
The born racist thing is not necessarily true but i get what you mean
Just be careful on that
Alex was born to play only ganondorf tho
Turn off everything for now
Thats true
<@493178993814798346> if u need anything lmk
^
<@!493178993814798346> And take your touch id/ face id OFF if you really there
Yeah just keep your location off
Just yeet it off
That too
airplane mode
Touch Id/face Id don't do much.
Yikes stay safe
Those are stored locally
Delete them
Its getting heated out there
if it turns sour have some phone number written on your skin
Fbi can access your phone through that
Honestly thats a good idea
But not passcode
> Those are stored locally
<@!314229461396488195> its more that police can't force you to give them ur passcode but touch/face id is fair game
Not if Diana forces the biometrics off
All she has to do is press her power button a million times I think
Or just turn the phone off
And if they turn it back on
Actually I don‚Äôt think police can legally force you to unlock
It's disabled
Regardless of method
They can technically
Really depends
They need a warrant
if they start placing jammers get out
just eat your phone
i mean, i feel like not legally doing a lot of things has kinda gone out the window no
When governments get desperate they will retaliate violently so just keep yoself safe
Like rn
Yeah honestly its really up in the air
Also
Placing too much faith in upholding the law rn is scawey
Covid didn‚Äôt disappear over night
Police might not care
Yeah
It did not
Beware large crowds Dino
Covid is still rampant
That too
Its a big reason for this huge push too
Stress of covid definitely didnt make anything easier
But hey who cares they reopened restaurants and bars and people had large gatherings at beaches so everything is fine now right?
Yeah i mean
...
they're reopening disneyland
idk why
If im ahppy right
but hey
perfect to get sick again
Because economy is better than human rights and human safety
Lots of people at these protests also not wearing masks
<:monkaS:442185930867081218>
The people that are actually protesting are
yeah
i can excuse racism but i draw the line at not getting a haircut /s
the people breaking in and looting aren't
wearing masks
The ones that are there to feel ‚Äúmorally good‚Äù for a day are t
Yeah
But still part of the crowd so stay safe if yall go out there
I believe everything can be solved with a BMW. If you wanna make a statement. Use force by BMW
<a:aniEvilPlan:657098437040537600>
The saddest shit is once this blows over if nothing is done to help these people out and actually make change we‚Äôll be fighting the same issue in another couple years
Yea just ram the barricades haha
^
Yeah
Or be a cop and run people over
<a:monkaShoot:699841146943176734>
I was gonna say, that's what the police did!
But hey that‚Äôs not being recorded soo it‚Äôs fair game right?
And all that is left is just thousands of hurt people and small businesses
Not if I buy a mustang and run the cops over first
<a:monkaShoot:699841146943176734>
If nothing happens
Hopefully somethign comes out of this
Corporate America will only feel the hit from this for a couple months sadly
Oh definitely
Im only concerned for small businesses
And homes
THEY BETTER NOT REOPEN DISNEY WE DONT EVEN HAVE A VACCINE YET
REEEEEE
they are planning too
sadly
Because itll impact their lives for decades if nothing happens
My friends story had gunshots in it when she was just chilling at home
Yikes
Yikes
Yea
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
But disney
Is not small
I‚Äôm not sure wether I‚Äôm hearing gun shots or fireworks again.
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fireworks season yet
There‚Äôs gonna be hella gunshots in Texas
My city has a protest going on rn and the shopping district
But I do hear the cops with sirens on at 2 am
We actually just had fireworks in ptown
the national guard landed in dtla at 3am
Scawey
Pretty worried there will be a mass shooting to be honest
for a protest that turned violent cuz of the cops
Also becareful our there people are talking about bringing out their guns to quell the protests
Viva la revolution
More like second civil war
> Also becareful our there people are talking about bringing out their guns to quell the protests
Dw if they‚Äôre white that‚Äôs ok \s
DO YOU HEAR THE PEOPLE SONG
Sing*
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
Actually
No \s
That‚Äôs literally already happened
They haven‚Äôt done shit about anyone with guns
At least not in Texas or Indiana
That‚Äôs how we got 4 dead people in Indiana
I love the casual let whites protest at our government buildings, because they wanted a haircut
Literal armed militias showing up
Protest with _assault rifle_
And they didn‚Äôt do anything
And trump says they‚Äôre ‚Äúgood people‚Äù
Got it
Y‚Äôall hear about how anonymous is back
yes
yeee
i saw the video
Yup
that shit is wild
they took down the Minneapolis website right
its been a while
Yeah
That‚Äôs actually crazy
2020 is literally a fucking movie u can not change my mind about this
Its not a movie
It's a series
Oh I wonder what June will have in store forces
<@!345083648124649485> lets watch 2012
For us*
we're currently on the revolution arc
mmmmmmmmmmmm pride month
racism homophobia transphobia and more
plus the racist gays are gonna come out to paly woO
You make it sound like a value deal
Oh god
RACISM HOMOPHOBIA TRANSPHOBIA
But wait there more
there's already some stuff about lgbtqia+ accounts getting harassed and doxxed
WITH EVERY PURCHASE OF THE KAREN YOU GET A FREE TOY
reminder that the first pride was a riot lol
This is going to sound real bad, but imagine a confederate flag but as a rainbow. That was the first imagine that came to mind with racist gays
The racist guys love the confederate flag tho
Its ‚Äúwhite culture‚Äù
The only white culture i like is yogurt
Not guys Wilson
Oh
Gays
My bad

Read that wrong
Ew wtf
<:PEPESCREAM:466446495747670027>
Omg it exists
üòÇüòÇ
Wtf
I mean of course it exists it‚Äôs the internet
Ask and you shall receive
this is a thing
Hey can we uhh talk about something less depressing? Whats everyone doing today?
But I feel like most protests and movements have been turned violent, not by the people speaking their cause but by those trying to silence them
^
Its a mix bag
Sorry sorry state of the news today, we had one good thing yesterday and that‚Äôs about it
theres always going to be a selection of people just looting for the sake of looting
Yeah
and tkaing advantage of the current state
Yes the government never respected the right to assemble
but from what i can tell the police are more likely to have intigated the violence insteadof the other way around
Even if they say they do
Many people said lets go to beverly just to riot and loot
Scawey
There are people saying it‚Äôs ‚Äúprotestors‚Äù from out of state inciting the violence
<@!173261056225837056> the cops would use TEAR GAS to control crowds during an INFECTIOUS LUNG PANDEMIC
Its insane
I hope it gets better i dont want the protests to be shut down like this
Some may be home grown too though
yeah
Yeah tear gas rn is kinda be used willy nilly
the beverly hills protest
was fucking peaceful
and then the cops changed that too
Police have way too much power rn and thats the problem
Plus theyre sending in National Guard too
they did
I mean they could get the fire hoses that literally are strong enough to tear skin, or they could let people gather and arrest the people that want to destroy their message
the only news i see for beverly hills is literally just the protestors looting
but nothing is ever said that the police started shit
Trumps take ‚ÄúIf the people get looting our people will start shooting‚Äù or something along those lines
Is there evidence of that rn :0
Scawey
they're at least admitting it was peaceful at first
Video footage is hard to find rn
Yikes
Police pls
A lot of twitter is showing the peaceful footage before
^
Yeah
la mesa was peaceful
the shop owners were outside cheering them on
And the violence incited after
and then the police came and said fuck y'all
wussup i made it out
yay dino!!
ayyyy nice
stay safe
how was it?
Woo
I can‚Äôt say news networks are completely invalidated, but if they cannot fear monger then they don‚Äôt tend to show it
honestly it was peaceful until the popo arrived
but they called it an unlawful assembly bc people started blocking the streets
which i mean yeah
ITS NOT UNLAWFUL ASSEMBLY <:PEPESCREAM:466446495747670027>
You know if they started showing up in their regular uniforms and not riot gear maybe it would cause a lot less tension
ITS CIVIL UNREST
Unlawful assembly is big cop out
Tell that to the protestors of covid-19 blocking nurses from getting to work
Oh wait
Reeee
This is such a shit show
This is America
Our administration isnt helping at all either
Yeah ik
lmao our administration is more focused on making sure trump is getting birthday messages
> We are literally living in another civil rights movement, not to gain the rights but to protect and to have the rights of black people and all people of color their rights to actually be enforced and protected
<@!213151486434082817> !!!!
Yesh
That was the answer i was looking for
> <@!186009830484344843> gonna second this one ya
<@!245736329382461440> gay rights literally exist bc of stonewall
wait you got that ad too <:pepeLMAO:490384254534942720>
Thonk
i saw it and was like donald trump doesnt deserve anything from me
Yep
ive gotten that ad like five different times already
What in the actual fuck
wait what ad
the fuck
> Fsecond
i got it once and i clicked the info thing and i was like
holy shit i‚Äôm so pissed off about the current admins. i just hope the people who weren‚Äôt able to vote four years ago but can vote now can come out and help get the orange out of office
admins as in
administration
"stop showing this to me because it's irrelevant"
not this server admins
Sad to say that the popular vote even if by a small margin didn‚Äôt vote for trump
wait i just realized
nvm
carry on
?
wha
doesn‚Äôt the electoral college need to be looked at too
iirc
like
absolutely
something something flawed
> The biggest changes and reform unfortunately was brought by violence
<@!186009830484344843> oh oop meant to reply to this but ya
But our broken as shit electoral college that over represents the minority gave him the vote
the electoral college is a twisted shitshow
<:uwu:468918270775263242>
yeah did yall see that map
let me find it
electoral college was first established because the old farts didn't trust the public to make decisions

this one
what is what a map of??
Counties voting
ahhhh
for 2016 election yeah
mid america be slackin
LMAO
theres no one there to begin with
The red are all the counties that got more representation
^
Lol Midwest is practically empty
but its like yeah sure a larger area is red but a lot more volume is blue
No one wants their home destroyed by a tornado
same energy as drowning 5 people by putting the mediterranean in australia
mid america is yee haw
<:thonk:440231969796784128>
grapes of wrath lookin asses
No it ain‚Äôt
Yee haw is Texas
Hahaha
<:GotGrapes:604860898104049664>
Kekeke
I may have hated Texas but I respect the fact they are their own thing
Basically another country
a gift

Most of middle America is basically uninhabitable
Oops wrong word
Stupid auto correct
Uninhabited
i propose that we even out the population by creating an underground city system
Independent power grid, own oil reserves, own reserve armed forces, has the flag at the same height as the US flag
Yee haw is wild
Crab people!
Maybe one day somebody will actually look at helping the Midwest
Instead of keeping em poor
Like they do with inner cities
Sam DM
Me shook
<a:monkaShoot:699841146943176734>
Yeah it‚Äôs pretty underdeveloped whenever you got out there
It‚Äôs like 1 major city then nothing
You say that like it's a bad thing
Okay maybe I worded that wrong
Don‚Äôt really know how to word it better either
i remember reading that like year one of trump being in he somehow hurt the midwestern farmers with some tariffs
talk about leopards eating ur face off
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
Trump is not in it for the laborers
And that‚Äôs all I can say about that
Trump tariffs did fuck farmers, but then he bailed them out
And by them I mean the rich ones
oh okay
OH OKAY
jesus
til about the latter part
It‚Äôs common practice in the Midwest to fuck the little guy
The ones controlled by the monopolies
Job rates in those areas are in sharp decline
üò¶
No plans for retraining
Just constant drama on *we will get your jobs back*
Or
*look who took your jobs*
The reality is the US didn‚Äôt prepare these areas for the global economy
And the post-industrial era
Cynics say it is exclusively to drum up votes
But that applies to the democratic policies for inner cities
Give with one hand and take with the other
It's cause some genius in washington back in the 90s decided that the united states was gonna have an "information economy" and that we didn't need manufacturing
so we shipped all those jobs to china
and now middle america is fucked
and they will continue to be fucked
as they have been for the past 3 decades
Thing is that could have worked if they put in place technical schools and training
Like Germany did
hell, closer to 5
When they enacted similar policies
But in essence
Yes
What you said
Instead they left middle America to rot
The thing is, it's such a stupid move
so out of touch
There's nothing wrong with working a manufacturing job
It was the smart move for the economy, but they weren‚Äôt willing to actually invest in making it work
Shit move for the people
The smart move would have been to evolve to more modern manufacturing
Which even *china* has done
Since
As they export industrial era manufacturing to other countries now
>united states
>smart move
things that make you go hmm...
<:monkahmm:716517873161601104>
<:kek:490008924414803968>
why didn't my parents choose to immigrate to canada
the united states just feels like this stupid fuckin experiment into how far we can take human greed before society collapses
what is 2020
<@!123253336198742016> is it maybe because the US represents the promise of opportunity and freedom to be ones self? 

TLDR: your parents got scammed
But still tho we are pretty fortunate to be able to enjoy the privelages we DO have in this country
Even if things are p fucked up atm
My dad‚Äôs brothers immigrated to Canada but my dad immigrated to the US because of the navy <:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
oh yea I mean I know why my parents picked america lmao
But canada has a massive Chinese population too due to hk going back to china in the 90s
it do be like that Lara :(
I could have been a canadian <:PepeHands:465022934281486346>
Ohhhhhh canadaaAaaaaaaa

F
yea dude
:/
im just very grateful
our community
hasn't stirred up some shit
there was one at ucsd
but
la jolla boomer pop
so
probably not much besides the pocket of people at ucsd
yeah
I told my brother that
and it wouldn't even matter because there's no one to see it there
no students at sd
and even if there are they're in the dorms/off campus
<a:hahakek:676470025317777484>
yuh but downtown was peaceful today
mostly
then police came
these live streams of people in protest areas are crazy
like jesus fucking christ though, i understand protest, but it's like they also forgot about covid, and the not protesters aka looters
<a:PEPEHELL2:695431293541941276>
it's mainly the latter latter
ridiculous year
<a:FeelsSuperWeirdMan:532325255721517059>
Fuck 2020
Hello i'd like to return my copy of 2020 its not  what i thought it'd be
^
<a:PEPEHELL2:695431293541941276>
These kids out making me wanna go full yee haw
i hope the 2021 release is better
the looters are pissing me off
I loved where I lived in SF
They ruined it
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
It was just a cute place
<:FeelsBadMan:441463646124507136>
i can tolerate the violence against police buildings etc, but <a:PEPEHELL2:695431293541941276> quit destroying businesses, you know damn well we live in a corporate ass country
new years finna be 13/1/2020
<:curserat:642191598259798043>
And houses now too
Heck they are close to getting into federal buildings
Where they will then all get shot
Or face federal charges
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
They have the real armed forces on those buildings, because its the only ones where they can
And apparently if you are a federal security guard you just get killed
at this point is it even blm protesters and not just randos
<:sweat:713285695694831647>
im all for violent protest if needed but whoever the looters are
they needa go
<:cursecat:612044490307272727>
Where I lived in SF is zero protesting
Just rioting
Not a single sign
its mainly randoms, and people trying to incite this shit
^
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
Anarchists, antifa, violent arms of BLM, some right wing groups
protestors and people actually fighting the cause aren't trying to harm small businesses
Usual shit
yep
we love extremists from both sides
i mean
This country makes me wanna go home
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
ppl gonna take advantages when it's out there
this country make me wanna leave
At least we know when protesters are fake
And just throw the whole kitchen sink at them
**be practicing that 1st amendment**
hell this country makes me wanna go home to my country that isn't even my native country at this point since im a basic english bitch
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
im tired
i cant think straight
the problem is whether the uneducated masses can tell the differene
they can't
I hated Texas but these small businesses need stand your ground
they all clump rioters/looters as protesters
and there will ppl who will make sure the masses cant
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
One guy who tried to defend his shop that we know of is in a coma
an asian jewelry store was shooting bang bang bangs are looters
So thats nice
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
In yee haw there was this old 70-80 something black lady
Who pulled a shotgun on 'em
Needless to say folks ran
i'd pull a miss fortune and ult the looters all
good on her
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
Don't fuck with Texan liquor stores lmao
LOL
The laws are real strict on liquor in Texas
never EVER mess with liquor stores in general
So they are generally armed
Heck, even Specs (chain store) has an armed guard

How long before someone Mustangs a crowd
<@!314229461396488195>
Oh wait it already happened
Once by accident and once on purpose
i've been pinged
yes
and yes
i love protesters 100%, looters can die
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>

looters are just angrys taking away from the value of protest
Whatever happens they ain't touching my BMW
Or it'll be touching them

<:pepeOK:490384227729408000>
<:sweat:713285695694831647>  damn opportunists
those white people looting
but u cant stop them
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
Honestly the diversity is amazing
yeah it's not even the minorities looting it looks all like white people to me
If it were anything else I'd be genuinely impressed
in the videos
Its literally *everyone*
Its hilarious
Mostly young folks
they just want those vans that were on sale months ago but they forgot to buy
I'd say about 60% or so african american in a lot of areas, but thats mostly the demographics
<:kek:490008924414803968>
Rather than any particular majority of the population being involved
Deeeffinitely a fair few white folks in California though
WTF
someone broke into a mall and smashed in a mercedes coupe on display <@!181482518107783168>
<:peepoCryTeddy:471244526556807169>
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
Sounds about right

So spicy
ok tbh i find that more hilarious than disgraceful idk
I was laughing at the shear diversity in the looters earlier
Props for Houston keeping things peaceful
We had some angry folks, but the police are just walking with them now
That said, night has fallen

this is aobut to be my bmw
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>

<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>

wilson from castaway lmao
the volleyball
oh i thought you were talking about wilson
<:sweat:713285695694831647>
LOL
Same for a sec
LMAO LARA
but also yikes
I really dont support looting
^
looters are not protesters as far as im aware
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
they say not all cops well i say not all protestors
hi biggo
issa wild dino
agree
those people think this is an opportunity to take shit
<a:COGGERS:588215562786832384>
also the police sirens are escalating around my area
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
lara do you hear them
As I said in the other channel, I've been watching people try and pay people to riot
For a few days now
On streams
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
sam i need a garage
f10 needs safety
I wish I had space
Worst comes to worst
My apartment
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
your del mar one??
Torrey Gardens
They'll never get to that
But they might get to Del Mar
oh
They threatened to
People here would fight back though
This area is uhhhh
Maybe 60% older asian, 40% older white
(my area specifically, not Del Mar as a whole)
The view of the rioters here is *very* negative
i just want all of this to end
<:pepehands:464568955533524992>
Guess if these kids want a real revolution it'll be time to pick a side
<a:PepePopcorn:554328145344462848>
i woke up 5 min ago and the first thing i thought was "wow wouldn't it be nice if my brain were to shut down for good"
i feel extremely compassion-fatigued rn
<:sadBoi:663441916465119285>
I know that feeling
I took a break from this discord a couple days ago
for like 2 days
because I was feeling so down
and didn't wanna accidently hurt someone emotionally or bring them down
take your time
my ability to sympathize/empathize with people has significantly declined since the start of quarantine
I think as we stop communicating w/ people as frequently we just start losing these social skills
<:FeelsBadMan:441463646124507136>
definitely
i've noticed I haven't been able to communicate my happy feelings with people
because its too clouded with uncertainty
and sadness from quarantine
i facetimed my friend earlier and i haven't talked to her ever since quarantine happened
<:peepocry:640363747990306827>
<:pepecry:712987584976125952>
Stay strong friends <:PepeHeart:567839212557172737>
ty chrisso
Im like kinda introverted n not that emotional id like to say so im just kinda like watever like i havent rly been clouded by negative emotions personally but like
chris my child
Idk i just feel like im losing my social skills
stoof i miss you <:pepekms:712984803678486579>
And im like will i be able to adapt to society once i come back <:FeelsBadMan:441463646124507136>
quarantine gets so hard as it keeps getting extended
or will my introvertedness take over <:FeelsBadMan:441463646124507136>
it probably wont end anytime soon
personally i got really happy at ucsd cause i made so many good friends
yup
and getting my first year cut short
same same
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
and not being close to anyone back home
makes it so hard
Not much changed for me
I had just begun being more social
and extroverted
and then all of a sudden
I highkey would have rathered getting my first yr cut short than my second yr KEK
bam
qurantine
yeah i know what you mean
and im like fook
man
I just moved from living with one person back to family
just as I was getting confident in myself
you come in  like no you can't see friends
and be social
yeah i feel that <:pepecry:712987584976125952>
im just holding on and trying to be on discord as much as possible now
i dont use words irl anymore
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
Must have sucked
lowkey i feel kinda bad for all the extroverts
bout to start using emotes irl
<:Pepesad:601573092992745472>

Deathadder gang

G502 and Deathadder are the ogs
I've had 3 Deathadders
I have a overwatch chroma one
i like the 402
the first one, the 3G, and a chroma

And I'm terrible at shooters
Mouse collectors be like
Sensei is also a classic choice
Or a Rival
stonks
ok i need a new body, soul and everything
i just lost all the will to work
i just use a regular usb mouse that was like 10$
and i have shit due
yall wack
Why buy a gaming mouse
When you can buy 3 custom keycaps
y buy a gaming mouse if ur gna lose at the game anyways
wait i want a custom key cap
i bought my gaming mouse cause it was ergonomic
<a:hahakek:676470025317777484>
lmao shih wen
I bought another G502 because it was cheaper than buying another deathadder
<:kek:490008924414803968>
Maybe 2 if you get super dupper cool ones
but i only have a laptop üò¶
i want my keyboard to come in üò≠
This G502 Hero was 39$
What laptop though
I would buy one with a lil sloth I side

<@!252670263848599563> have you tried good keyboards tho? üëÄ
i like the tippy tap
andrew's laptop was kinda flexible
The clack clack is missing
like a person doing the splits
lmao
YA
CLACK CLACK
i dont use my laptop for things other than internet tbh
clack clack
and occasional mc
Best keyboard i've ever had was an ancient dell mechanical 15 years ago
I have, wasn't super pleased
clack
the sound of the clack clack is everything
I like the short keys
i kinda need a laptop with more ram even though 8gb doesn't really seem to be slowing me down
If I bring my desktop
maybe i just need a quad core
<:thonk:440231969796784128>
I just need faster RAM
I'ma need to get silencers or a new keyboard
quad core isn't standard?
New MacBook keyboard has a nice clack clack
im living in 2017
My 3200mhz RAM is throttling infinity fabric
i need to get the new macbook pro
<a:pepeLaugh:663444889798705169>

wtf brianna
My desktop has a 2008 cpu üòî
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
But it just doesnt provide the same clack clack
Gangshit
Bc of its lack of depth
With a 1070
I need a real laptop

It‚Äôs a scissor keyboard though
If u take over ur common area

I had a roommate this year that did that
Wat Are Scissor Keyboards
I hated him
LMAOOO
y
before the bad macobok keyboard
Can't get a Macbook because I actually use touch screens, can't get another XPS 15 because Dell put in a 300 cycle battery
nows ur chance to be that roommate
snadu
Finna catch a fade with me
Like Apple used to
in all serious dont be that roommate
<:pepehmm:520539005477978123>
i need to search up a pic
apple reverted back to their old keyboard
basically
^
Its identical in design
They actually listened for once
He was so dirty
i took over my common area this yr bc my roommate was super sensitive and slept at midnight and woke up at noon
And kinda racist to me when we first met
oh
Anyone with creativity is long gone from Apple
they also made it thiccer again for a slightly bigger batteyr

In the other room
Lmao imagine talking to your roommates

Wtf now my lamp is spazzing out
F

my first year wack asf my second yr was relatively chill
<:thonk:440231969796784128>
My suite mates avoided making eye contact with me

What do you mean Wilson
james y
for a desktop
watd u do to them
you can have the biggest psu you want
my power supply
Idk

Maybe there's a limit I have no power now anymore wtf
They were just like that
Unless you are me pre GTX 1080
We didn‚Äôt talk much
o
Who was near the limit of my old AX 1200
<a:ohohoho:636686946734964786>
I got an apt this year
what hte avoided contact
in warren?
Constantly ran it near 1150W
At least only 1 guy was dirty
nah bc i wanted to get a 750w seasonic but they only have the 850w available
F
and theyre about the same price
Yeah I was in Douglas
everyone in my apartment was clean
<a:pepeLaugh:663444889798705169>
Just get the 850
chris i think
edward

Rather than like 4/15 being dirty in a suite
of my apartment
You might need it who knows
on snapchat
Your apt was so clean

LMAO
Intels CPUs eat stupid power and are terrible
OMFG
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>

We LIVED IN THE SLUMS
all of us in the apartment were just very clean
<a:ohohoho:636686946734964786>
My 3900X tops out at about 210W
i HATE HATE HATE ppl who do not do their dishes for a whole week
always cleaned up after ourselves
Seemingly
paradise
<:monkaGIGA:585569750281748481>
we all cleaned our dishes RIGHT AFTER using them
<a:ohohoho:636686946734964786>
no dleya
delya
delay
inglish
In my apartment we rinsed and left them for a week or two
my apt would be too high to do dishes
xinglish
damn it
Then just used our dishwasher
so it usually fell on me as the only sober one
<:ahah:567191707079409705>
Part of our ceiling fell off
:' )
wtf
ok ok i actually need to disappear
<:Pepescream:478988294106120194>
Halfway through winter

Don't do it
Dry wall all over the bathroom and shower

That was an F
how long did it take to get fixed o.o
It happened like w3? And it was "fixed" just before finals week iirc
When we left we could see the ceiling start to look bad again so I wouldn't be surprised if it falls again lol
so did u guys just like
not shower for 6 weeks
<:yeet:442868651792793601>
did yall not
Call hdh
We called them right away lol
No we didn't shower
We just used a lil dish soap before we had to go out tbh
<:yeet:442868651792793601>
Got the job done
i-
Had to keep the engineering tradition alive
that is
Ya know
I-
i mean
exceeding expectations
u know there r buildings on campus w showers right
gotta give credit where its due
Nah it's chill we decided it was better to study
i-
Also we usually got a nice spot in Geisel
People just seemed to clear out whenever we chose somewhere to sit
It was really nice
<:yeet:442868651792793601>
<:monkaS:442185930867081218>
I cant tell if ur joking or srs
n it scares me
LMAOOO
Nah bro we could still shower haha
ok bc there r some ppl who deadass smell like they do thay
in some of the cse classes i been in
We couldn't shower for like 3 hours when hdh came to fix
and my suitemate first yr would rinse only
<:FeelsBadMan:441463646124507136>
But it was in the middle of the day who cares
no soap
Yikesssssss
I copped a loofa
Best purchase ever I even got it pink
i dont like loofas theyre kinda itchy
pink is the manliest color change my mind
I can't
I don't want to
pink was originally a masculine color no?
then hitler changed it or some shit like that
idr the story
But yeah for like 5 weeks we had a big ass dehumidifier in our restroom so the drywall could settle and we could still shower with hot water
So ghetto
damn hdh rly said fuck u
we love hdh
Tape over the cable so we wouldn't kill ourselves lol
thats a big F
hdh was pretty good my 2nd yr
we said we were missing a trash can when we moved in
Yeah our apt sucked ballllllllllzzz
And then they came 6 dif times w trash cans
And then we had 10 extra trash cans
Buuuuhdhakkdkfkals
rip marshall flooding <:pepekms:708511036411609099>
no joke the trash cans were like
6 ft apart
bc we had so much
We had a lizard sneak into our apt one day too
there was 3-4 in the common area
He got in through the window lol
By the time I got back they had thrown him out
But the way I see it
He wanted to be our pet
wait free pet
KEK
wtf
And we denied him
F
I will never forgive my apt mates
Fomies
tb to when we had 3 fish in our apt
and they all died 1 by 1
mood
I literally have no power at home still
We had 1 fish
ok well 2 were murdered but
Am I Amish now or what
Think its still alive

WAIT QUESTION
is anyone else getting ‚Äúaction blocked‚Äù messages from instagram

what were you trying to do?
like before rhat it was EVEN MORE
i was pressing on the comment section of a post
but it was BLM related and the action blocked is happening everytime i‚Äôm doing something BLM related LOL
tinfoil hat time
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
also is it possible to get shadowbanned on instagram <:wsVsU7mxSU2FdfU5NtpgQA_thumb_470:688600982212706336>
the mind police are here to censor you
stop ur scaring me !
<a:sadshakeoffthetears:699396332183486494>
lol I kid
i think someone may have reported you or something like that but dw it should subside by tomorrow or something
that emote LOL
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
if someone reported me im throwing hands
<:pain2:706947574732423188>
They are probably trying to moderate info so nothing crashes
<a:catmemeendsyou:632629976449024061>
I can only imagine the strain their systems are under
It‚Äôs not built for the kind of live posting it‚Äôs being used for
That said they can shadowban if enough people report you I believe
BRU
Heated times folks
I wish you Americans well

covid came through and said no no no
you thought
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
other way around?
wat
you mean by other way around
idk i thought covid would force most ppl off campus
rather than on
oh, nah cause some people wont even come during fall
i think the people i was gonna live with wont come during fall
who do they b
it be
caitlin, xinchen, uh zoey, then aaron,
the gorls were gonna room together
but yeah covid struck through and put a blockade
on everything
<a:hahakek:676470025317777484>
covid said u can‚Äôt have cait
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
cuz they know she‚Äôs mine

<:birb:636686833002217492> <:birb:636686833002217492> <:birb:636686833002217492>
she was gonna be homeless
i would never let that happen
kevin swapped his spot out for caitlin
i‚Äôd move my mans out
and have her come
well now you wont
just take caitlin
<a:hahakek:676470025317777484>

<a:hahakek:676470025317777484>
i guess kevin can come back now
but yeah housing plans for everyone is all messed up now
very glad i took the option of signing my housing contract
<:shook:606018427018149889>

signing it
i would love to booty booty w ur bf

<:yeahnina:713286883257352223> <:yeahnina:713286883257352223> <:yeahnina:713286883257352223> <:yeahnina:713286883257352223> <:yeahnina:713286883257352223> <:yeahnina:713286883257352223> <:yeahnina:713286883257352223> <:yeahnina:713286883257352223> <:yeahnina:713286883257352223> <:yeahnina:713286883257352223> <:yeahnina:713286883257352223>
there you have it joanne
we have to set them up to an ass fight
it is written
must happen by law
and i have a 4 year housing guarantee vs other people
cause remember scholarship
wow don‚Äôt hurt us like this
F
ucsd looked me up and down and said fuck this dumb bitch
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
not a penny from ucsd
F
<:pepehands:464568955533524992>
i was granted it because ucsd had a relationship with my highschool
i guess they thought my dad had my back
one of the few high schools in SD
theh didn‚Äôt know my dad is broke af
<:pepehands:464568955533524992>
oof
esp now that his store got broken into
oh shit
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
the raids?
the raids
<:peepoCryTeddy:471244526556807169>
ya some looters
does he have insurance?
ya
you can always appeal for more financial aid joanne
ok that's good
it‚Äôll be fine
i know alex appealed like 3 times
how long do you have to appeal
caitlin appeal for financial aid sounds like loans
<:shook:606018427018149889>
:0 i kinda wanted to finish finals first
yeah it does
depends on what you're looking for
alex appealed for loan <a:poggerspls:585808456842215424>
cuz i also appealed and got more grant
WHAT THE
why is alex offline
<:cursecat:612044490307272727>
hes asleep
is he actualyl dead
NANI
<:nandatto:579878642537201665>
also tyty matt for letting me in
alex sleeps?
although idk whats gonna happen with the country in this condition
yeah caitlin you would've been granted accessed but i think
our housing fell apart
our housing plans anyways
it just shattered
yea is fine
covid out here
i dont really want to pay for fall either so i asked kevin about it
giraffe kevin?
ye i dont think xinchen is coming back for fall?
not sure
or she might
giraffe kevin
because i think she said she had a in class
class
F
he said depends if she gets into the galbraith hall one
she might be forced back
and zoey have no idea
when you say don‚Äôt come back, do you mean they‚Äôre just doing remote?
they're doing half remote
half online
galbraith hall sounds really intimidating, whatever it is
or uh mostly remote
some in class
this whole thing just kinda blows
i was looking forward to living in a cute la jolla apartment
^
i just want to not be at home
and having access to my vehicle at all times
like ucsd on a regular quarter deprived me of that and my car is my personality
as you all know
<a:hahakek:676470025317777484>
i barely have my car at ucsd right now if i can find parking on justice lane in warren
show us a car pic
with it's like 20 spots of parking
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
justice lane?
coming up
your car
my mom drove down to shihwens apartment
i saw stuff about ucsd parking being ass
and just parked wherever
LOL

i mean i still have my apartment at ucsd
so i have to park
and keep it stagnant
when i do stay
yeah true
<:pepehands:464568955533524992>
sometimes i get good parking other times i dont
justice lane is disgusting
and where did joanne go she requested a car pic
<a:hahakek:676470025317777484>
wow the angle on that pic
yeah it was a weird angle
i went to kill my eyes
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
i clicked nina‚Äôs spotify link
and it went full white
on my eyes
LOL
i just wanted to enlarge the photo
F
matt is still listening to twice
icu
üëÄ
<:aha:612044524927057921>
twice always
<a:ohohoho:636686946734964786>
i like cheer up a lot still
mina‚Äôs line gives me chills
<:PatrickWeary:579976188487794699>
i should really go back to the older ones
beautiful classics
but i hated their actual cheer uniforms
i learned the dance for cheer up at some point
the special outfits were super cool
loved the mv concept
^
yesss

"no pressure, but I want you to go out there and set the world on fire"

how do you guys feel abt gifts for a kid doing badly in school, make the gift seem like a reward for doing well or give them a seasonal gift regardless?
people get seasonal gifts?
yeah
a... seasonal gift?
yall get gifts?
i just get *beat*
^^^
preach
but in all seriousness can you pls elaborate on what you mean by seasonal gift? and the context of this situation? (if you feel comfortable)
depends on
their age imo
i wouldn't give a young kid a gift saying it's a reward for doing well if they're doing badly
imagine not getting yelled at by your parentals every day üôÇ
imagine them not looking over your shoulder everyday to see what youre doing
<@!446932571192819713>  sounds too good to be true
yeah ill elaborate, my younger brother is 11yo and I bought him a 144hz monitor since I myself never grew up with one and always wanted one when I was younger, so I knew how appreciative he would be when he got older, 
but he's not doing very well in school so im not sure if it's appropiate to give him a gift when all he does is play videogames and not schoolwork
he's in 5th grade so like, it's really hard to judge his performance anyways
<:wotthink:441465363671154698>
Honestly it‚Äôs quite typical for younger kids to just play games all day every day nowadays
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
i was only allowed to play video games on weekends when i was a kid D:
^ yep
id say if anything try to use it as motivation to do better in school
^
rather than just like
ope here ya go
i hate it but it was probably for the best
but i was only rewarded when i did well in school
same jenny/tomer
understandable
"rewarded"
"here you get a burger today"
üôÇ
~~given food and not yelled at~~
^^^
LOL
EXACTLY
damn i never even had a pc till i was like 13
looking back, "wow basic necessities and mental health" yay
we had an old ass dell family computer lol
miniclip was fire though
lmao same but it was a laptop
<@!580246928596664321> yeah I grew up like that too, playing videogames every day and being shocked when some of my friends said they could only play on the weekends, the only difference was that I still did all my hw/stuff first
we had this hella old dell laptop and i think all i played on it was solitare and minesweeper
tfw you still dont have a 144hz monitor <:pepehands:464568955533524992>
D:
christian
when you make big bucks with your comp eng degree
dw
you'll have **3** 144 hz monitors üôÇ
don't forget me tho üò†
240hz*
i have 2 monitors
buy yourself a 144hz monitor rn üôÇ
if you forget me christian, you'll actually be dead üò†
neither is above 60
but issok
quantity over quality rn
üëç
one day, buddy
<:wotthink:441465363671154698>
<@!173286369026637824> valorant
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
honestly that reminds me of when my parents used to restrict me only 2 hrs of pc everyday
today
rip aedan
it be like that
mayhaps
if i get my work done early
but that restriction went away after i got my pc
doubtful but maybe
<:pepeOK:490384227729408000>
but thats high school
join us for in house valorant, christian
LOL mood my parents restricted my gaming based on my test scores
valorant in house*?
A- on a test/quiz = x amt of hrs
i would wish for a console like every new years
ah i was just expected to get good grades
never got one lol
D:
santa ain't real
who hurt u jenny
yes
damn my parents never paid too much attention in my school work
since we came to the sttes
<:peepocry:640363747990306827>
but that didnt mean i just slack off tho <:peepocry:640363747990306827>
but <@!84197211113533440> id say give it to him but expect something to come from it too
when u ask for a pokemon game and you get a pokemon booster pack from santa
oof
like a increased focus in school or maybe he gets more interested in pc's and starts learning that way
for me 
one way to maintain focus even when i can play games whenever is that i tend to play games that makes me feel interested
cough* **RTS games** cough*
factorio
man i still remember playing RoTK and Nobunaga's Ambition games
<:pepeOK:490384227729408000>
one of the earliest online games i played was this top down shooter
i can't really remember what it was called but it was like red vs blue
**armor games**
<@!173286369026637824> truee, hm it's about to be summer for him next monday so i cant really ask for him to study/do work in the summer.. ill do what you said and say it's on his promise that he'll do good in the future
i used to grind kongregate
and there were game modes like king of the hill
and rotmg
> <@!173286369026637824> truee, hm it's about to be summer for him next monday so i cant really ask for him to study/do work in the summer.. ill do what you said and say it's on his promise that he'll do good in the future

<:peepocry:640363747990306827>  life was easier back then
<:peepocry:640363747990306827>
I still play BTD6
yeah as long as hes learning new stuff it doesnt have to be schoolwork
<:peepocry:640363747990306827>
my first introduction to tactic optimization
i couldnt game properly till i built my pc
_aggresively trynna stack towers_
<:kek:490008924414803968>
> yeah as long as hes learning new stuff it doesnt have to be schoolwork
<@!173286369026637824> maybe you can do something like a little project that gets him interested?
if it looks cool it might work
<:hypers:471374617337135134>
so i sorta taught myself linux and installed ubuntu on the family pc so it wouldnt be so process intensive lol
i still suck at it and it didnt really work out
but at least i tried and learned something out of it
> i still suck at it and it didnt really work out
this right here is my entire cs career

oh wait forgot but
good morning guys
Thirty fucking two percent. I give up from this school, I really do.

All that fucking hard work for nothing. The overall experience is absolute trash but I thought, maybe, the reputation would save it but just look at that shit. 1 in 3. What the fuck. That's middle america tier. Just let anyone in! Worked hard? Come on in! Did you work just a bit more than usual? Come on in!

I got fucking regents, they bought me the fuck out, but fuck this I should have gone to USC or UCLA and just take the L on the debt. All the sacrifices I made for prestige and money: working extremely hard for 1530 SAT, giving up social life, giving up a dream school atmosphere and experience all for fucking nothing, all absolutely out the fucking window. When anyone can get in like this what's the point in working so hard to pull yourself out of the herd? Any fucking dumbass can make it in here. I am fucking done with this place.

I'm going to be obsessed just to get post-graduate work so I can erase this embarrassment from my life.

If this was your "target" school and you made it in, congrats, but just to let you know as you have realized: you're not very ambitious and you settled for very little.
make that trigger
when you type ucsd
oh my
good idea
LOL
china
FUCK YEAH
and oops sorry for spam

aight i am done with spam

why is this emote called ucsd
wait did you delete jof
no
triton bot has
oH
limited functionality for custom reactions
what that mean
i am five years old in cs terms
fprintf('Hello World')
basically
triton bot scans each message
and checks if the message is literally only "ucsd"
moon god on the other hand i think just checks if test is in a specific message
so if i talk about testing enough
what about whitespace
it will eventually pop up
ucsd
whitespace gets ignored ig
ahhhhh
if message is 'ucsd':
ufck
i can't
tye
yea something like that lara
ucsd
just type better
it works when ucsd is socially distancing
icic
ucsd
yea
i think discord just cuts whitespace
<@!334441828512432129>  i think discord automatically removes whitespacing

the amount of entitlement in fucking ppl sometimes man i swear
its enough to really wanna make you strangle them sometimes
like just grab him by the neck and whisper to him you dont deserve to breathe this fucking air
you literal piece of shit
and watching him suffocate
it's best to just not take it seriously, you know
while you're here complaining about 32 percent there are ppl who wish they had the opportunity of higher education
yea but it was a real post
by a real person
i know it was real
always some wack ass peeps u know
don't let them get to u
true true
not that i would ever do that lol
but i would certainly like to sometimes
violence is never condoned even if you hate the opposing view or person <@!219584106550263809>
i know you're exaggerating but remember that this is a public discord
and some people may feel uncomfortable with violent remarks
yea ok got a bit heated there
i just cant stand these kinds of people
its quite understandable
please keep what I said in mind tho, this goes to everyone especially during these trying times
yes of course
if it were up to me tho id kick this guy out of ucsd and have him blacklisted from every university in the country
and let him back on the one condition that he make a public apology to the entire university
and then say sike you didnt want to come here anyway lmaooo
and then let him back in fr because im not a monster
learn some humility fool
i wouldnt do that because at the end of it all, he worked to get into this school and people should not be attacked by threat of expulsion for their words
Anger is understandable, but especially in these times violence is 100% not the answer. Even if you mean it as a joke or lightheartedly, etc.
you can be mad at that but that doesnt mean you should get kicked out
Also, remember that we have said things when we were younger that we don't believe anymore
A lot of people change their views when they grow up
I remember being someone who used to care about ranks more than anything
Now, no
> i wouldnt do that because at the end of it all, he worked to get into this school and people should not be attacked by threat of expulsion for their words
<@!181933280487014402>  he also got in because of privilege. I guarantee you many more ppl worked much harder than him and didnt get shit.
<@!219584106550263809> please check your dms
> he also got in because of privilege. I guarantee you many more ppl worked much harder than him and didnt get shit.
and less, too
You don‚Äôt know how hard he worked from his statement, you just know that he cares a lot about exclusivity
> <@!181933280487014402>  he also got in because of privilege. I guarantee you many more ppl worked much harder than him and didnt get shit.
<@!219584106550263809> i mean thats why the school is so diverse. If you think about it, if the school admitted a bunch of students who put in the same effort, out athletic team wouldnt be as good as it is now, out education field would not be as diverse as it is now, theres a lot of reasons why the school accpets people regardless of the effort they put in
(I'm very conscious of the fact that I got into UCSD simultaneously without trying, and as a fluke.)
(Fluke, because my HS GPA unweighted is well below mean.)
my hs made it easy for us <:FeelsBadMan:441463646124507136>
(Still haven't resolved the underlying issues.)

i really dont understand what you mean by privilege, wilson, but imo everyone has a different experience with admissions. i know some people who feel like theyre below "average" in terms of numbers, i know people who are probably above "average", and theres people like me, who think they're sitting right around where they belong
anyway
MOON GOD HAS FRIENDS?????
by all rights, I *probably* shouldn't have gotten in to UCSD
yeah and we all come from different backgrounds
especially given priors of background
*sigh*

does anyone know "ucsd tomphamdinh" on val/league
nope
nope
n
nope
but i found his op.gg
interesting
he's in my game xd
is he good?
idk
tomphamdinh looks familiar in valorant
only one round so far
but i never seen it with the ucsd
it looks like he's a big lol player
prolly another way to say tom hampton?
no
its viet
oh
yea i think that makes alot more sense than tom hampton tbh
> prolly another way to say tom hampton?
<@144994874570047488> jef u got me fuckin ROLLING
I JUST
I ADORE UR TRAIN OF THOUGHT
TOM HAMPTON
oh tomphandinh
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
tomphamdinh > tom hampton
i see it now
cannot unsee
tomppabeats
Sounded it out
:((
Pls dont roll
tht was a p good guess tho
Very bad for you
all the more rzn to do it
Mdma can fuck up your brain
Also apparently #whitelivesmatter is trending on twitter
But it's all kpod
Kpop
me looking at my depression and anxiety issues: oh really
yeah i saw it, it's a nice way to troll
kpop stans be amazin tbh
<:ohohoho:528367447472865284>
i hope it discouraged the ppl who started the hashtag from posting more
<a:ohohoho:636686946734964786>
kpop stans take no shit usually
<:aha:612044524927057921>
Oh i thot kpop stans were racist for a sec
and will overturn bullshit
if needed
Kpop stans were trying to cancel some musician the other day
Cause he used a sample of Jim Jones
im part of kpop twt and the way..... they can be weird sometimes
Never saw how that turned out
oh dear let's not talk abt bts
That was BTS they were canceling?
Yeah
Behind the scenes of movies is great
I love when they spammed the police apps with fancams
I thought they were like the biggest group
What happened
personally i don't like tht he sampled the speech bc yikes
oh ok so
james
to give context
Bruh if death grips can sample manson, BTS can sample Jim Jones
Sample whoever you want
It makes your music interesting
i get tht i just get weirded out when ppl use samples of murderers in their music
thats like the point tho?
I've just never been one to shout down artists for their creative choices
bts is undoubtedly the most well known kpop grp but they get backlash bc part of their fandom is batshit crazy and v elitist
It's like the whole satanic panic thing that metal as a genre had to put up with
it's just bullshit
ya but for me i'm not comfortable with wht yoongi from bts did but anyway
The only K-pop stan I like personally know is a bts stan
so even if bts is rlly well known, ppl sometimes resent their fans for being overzealous and condescending, bc these individuals actively tear down current and past gen kpop to uplift bts and boast of their superiority
i could never be a kpop fan simply bc i can not remember more than 3 names at a time
And theres like 12 of them in one group
o army is scary
Can confirm
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
i felt that Wendy
I cna't rememvber names
for the life of me
<:xd:612726759846051861>
I can listen to a band for 6 years
Same Shih Wen
and not know all their names
I forgot andrew for a full year
<:kek:490008924414803968>
true
wait til hear abt nct: there's 21 of em
King Gizzard has like 7 people in it, and I only know the names of like 4
bruh
i rmb going to caitlin n asking who tf kept saying hi to me otw to class
I remember my friend told me to name everyone in nct
And I did
And they were like wtf
BAHAHAHAH
that's like bigger than most of the classes were at my middleschool
stonks
i dont even have 21 friends
Imagine having 3 friends
couldn't be me
Imagine having friends
they're in subunits but in 2018 they all collabed (the 18 tht existed at the time)
yeah i listen to kpop bands, i wont remember their names
wait yall have friends?
unless they all come out one by one like loona
<a:hahakek:676470025317777484>
where do i get one of those
tbh, I'd rather have like 1 or 2 really close friends than 20+ friends

i mean like i dont mind if we have a civil conversation but at the same time me scared of confrotnation yk
like when im arguing w someone i dont think straight
You can possibly just send a message to redirect their messages to the original ig
i did i did
sucks tht you're going thru this sandy, and there's def no rush in responding to these ppl right away
if at all if they're being rude
you can educate people but dont waste your energy on educating people that wont listen
<:thonkemplating:588683802763722752>
i empathize
ahh thank you guys
and even though i would've never willingly put myself in this situation like
this is the least i can do for people that have been treated poorly their entire lives
it is the ABSOLUTE least i can do. and because of that i know that what im doing is great despite what i might have to go through
i will gladly go through it in hopes of educating others and having people understand the movement

ya know im so surprised how widespread the protests have become
<:thonk:440231969796784128>
surprised?
really ?
like with the demonstrations in other countreis across the world
oh
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
i mean
it's for racism all over
im not surprised but super happy its happening
yeah not just the US
so ppl that go "wow i hate the us" is like deflecting in a way bc racism is prevalent everywhere
US isn't only subject to racism but it is definitely a worse problem here it seems
yep
lol in the us i know it was gonna be come big but like in some nations that dont like the US like Iran is providing encouragement to the protesters
oh tru
well because they're humans too
trump: iran dont kill ur protestors
wot
us protesters: bich dafuq
yeah there was like
a tweet in january or smth
o
lemme find lemme find
<:pepehmm:520539005477978123>

proles reminds me of 1984
and the hunger games
when my body refuses to sleep
i kind of just......... cover my eyes with a pillow
i just get angry at it
relax whole body
drop shoulders
n relax
like to think im floating in an ~ocean~
also bc the receptors in ur eye dont detect light it produces more melatonin. unless u alr sleep in pitch dark or smth
I have a little eye mask
i dont like eye masks bc light still gets in from the nose area but yas
anything that just makes it like DARK. like u cant even detect light outside of closing ur eyes
I try my best to get to that level of darkness
But I'm just restless tonight it seems
F
F is right
that doesnt help snadu
i just end up adapting to see in the dark
even with all lights off
Lol same

Do you ever just drive aimlessly back and forth between school and home without ever dropping her off, for the length of the entire school day, for no other reason other than you can?

I DONT KNOW WHY OK
i think its cuz ppl r scared of making the wrong choice
^
thats how i ee it atleast
which is understandable i mo
god i cant type
i usually either suppress feelings or just do what i do then act like i didn't do what i just did
<a:pepeLaugh:663444889798705169>
I, um
Let's not go there.

<a:hahakek:676470025317777484>

shush
https://tenor.com/view/reading-sign-cant-stop-me-no-one-can-stop-me-gif-13921932
i had to suppress them bc he was in relationships
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
ok
valid
lemme tell u my sad sad story
F
we had a thing in ninth grade
I'll get the tissue box
i ended it bc i was oompa loompa dumbass bich and scared of commitment
but then we still good friends
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
then he liked my bff from swim, i set them up
This is already a very sad story.
helped him ask her to hoco
well at least you know you're not committed and end it before going deep in and
unstable
helped him break up w her
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
helped him get back tgt with her
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
helped him break up with her again
ok im scared of snadu now
playing with fire over here
<:aha:612044524927057921>
and then he got into another one year relationship that recently ended but thats where we went MIA bc like...
Queue blackpink
they were those couples that ONLY hung out w each other
so i didnt talk to him for a while
and then april hits
quarantine p bad strains relationships
he goes to me for help
it does can confirm
i help him thru it and this is like the worst i've seen him at
and then end of april they break up
and now we're here
<:feelsbadman:584486296097914911>
<:blobcatsweatsip:411231776388677633>
i am og simp
<:pepesimp:704774872924160060>

INOJGEdfs
Simps unite
fax
i like how i was not simp till college
<a:hahakek:676470025317777484>
idk like i hate to be that person that idealizes others but im afraid i won't find someone like him again <:simp1:706947938831827016>

quite silly
<:pepehmm:520539005477978123>
That's another thing I don't understand
Why people hate being idealized
him
because they bash themselves and believe they will never be good enough for anyone
and when someone does think they're awesome
they shatter
owpefjdso
hi snadu
insecurities RISE
i called you out
what r u talking abt ! def not me .
<:pepesimp:704774872924160060>
we need that emote
<a:hahakek:676470025317777484>
also anyways i think that sentiment can be built from childhood stuff <:feelsbadman:584486296097914911>
i have to yoink it

I made an Apple Pay screen for my UI after another person suggested an image
Didn‚Äôt like it
Downloaded the whole Apple resource library
Recreated the whole thing
Animations included
yup, I see where this is going
Ported it all from XD to Figma
Even the fonts
And opacity
It should even automatically update depending on what you buy
(The text, cost etc)
wow
That sounds impressive
<a:pepeFAST:650248098483929108>
I just need to build an animation for the double tap the side button bit
Ooh dawn is in half an hour I think I can make it
But that would require breaking out an animation tool
Which might happen
I‚Äôm going insane
Lol, sounds like sleep might be good for everyone here
<:FeelsExhaustedMan:622864803916152842>

I'm at a live final review for my neurology class and there's 140 slides. Oh no.
oh no
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
that's a lotta slides
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
y'all ever have so much shit to do that you don't even know where to start
I just pick one either at random or whatever one I think will get done the fasted
being able to cross things off the list, even if there's a big thing, is really relieving and pretty encouraging
<:pepeOK:490384227729408000>
okok thats what i do too but i have like 10 million tabs open <:kek:490008924414803968>
about to just yeet them all and start anew
it hurts when i have 10 million tabs open but 5 million are on one screen and 5 million are on the other screen so im twice as overwhelmed
Lol
I hate it when I have too many tabs
only time I can have a lot of tabs open is when they're all resource links when im doing a paper
i have a lot of tabs open bc i would be doing a task and then i would remember something and then go check on that
then that new thing needs like 4 more tabs
and its just an endless cycle and i would go back to the very first thing i was doing. my life is quite a mess üôÇ
relatable jenny

yep yep
chillin
want it to be summer already
but lowkey hoping fall comes soon
I miss everyone ;-;
same ://
Not much left to do for this quarter in my case
so I been keepin myself busy
Low key might just stack up on classes and graduate a year early
If fall is completely online
fancy shmancy
im taking fall easier
i really struggled with the online format
motivation is too easy to lose
Yeah I feel that
rn I have 2 ges planned for fall
I stopped goin to classes bc all the recordings were online, and I did hw in that time instead
ez clap
yep
100
&
it's a good time management method I think
if you dont fall behind then yeah
but once the lectures pile up it can be kinda dauntin
yeah
Just gotta be careful
it's been interesting tho
meh for me the lectures are even less engaging especially when the profs are having tech issues or stuff like that
been hard to follow
Oh I meant in terms of structure
I only had one live lecture this quarter so I don't have much to say there
gm gamers

Same
> i dont like taking pictures of myself
<@!173286369026637824> u gotta do it . for the ladies.
and the ones i have arent that good lol
same
But thats because im ugly
^
chris if i had ur face as a guy id be taking
chris u can do it
or i dont think so
so many
but im not like that
like selfie taking is an art, and u gotta know ur angles
it's ok if ur not into it!!
trust
ive tried and it feels so weird hahaha
Im not fat is literally the only thing i have going for me
but when ppl take photos make sure they're coming out WELL at least
aw man
the fatphobia
gtg
sad reax bc im not photogenic
i think u look nice in pics dino!!
im lowkey conscious of my weight too <a:MD:496565330240602113>
Im talking about like obese level of fat
Not like
A bit meaty
and since i lost motivation to workout and go running im just like ok I dont have to eat that much today
diana you're fucking adorable
Cuz with my lifestyle i should really be obese lul
<:sweat:713285695694831647> now that i think bout it i've gained weight since i went home
<:FeelsBadMan:441463646124507136>
i used to lost weight bac in school bcuz i just *dont eat* and study
Doesnt help when ur parents always nag on your for never being able to put on weight

this is basically me
except im skinny
asian culture is telling you you're fat and then saying you dont eat enough
Same
throwback to when my mom commented about my weight instead of saying hi after three months of not seeing each other
oh god thats literally my mom when i went bac during winter break
Asian culture is telling you how you‚Äôre not good enough and why cant you do what [insert relative kids name] is doing
i hate it when azn parents act like it's their right to comment on their kids' bodies lmao
That pciture is basically me
<a:ohohoho:636686946734964786>
/']\giphy
I'm a lazy ass piece of trash
fatshaming is so prevalent
wtf just happened
my mom says im too skinny
and then they wonder why we dont share everything with them anymore
they want us to eat and then they're like ew no ur so big
like tf.
i want outtttttt
> Asian culture is telling you how you‚Äôre not good enough and why cant you do what [insert relative kids name] is doing
<@!184791890409816065> my case wat basically the same except it's [insert some neighbor's kid]
god bless im out of here after finals
im yeeting
<a:PepePopcorn:554328145344462848>
heck yeah
Im sure almost everyone can say something sumilar
Meanwhile British parents be like, *whatever you do, don't become an American*
And thats about it
okay fax
oof
they not wrong
i mean ive only had azn parents idk how other parents from other races parent
jenny u are indeed skinny
I mean, Britain isn't much better rn... :P
but
Well actually, its more of a passive aggressive parenting where you can do whatever you want but you are also just expected to know what you can and cannot do
skinny legend
:3
my parents just always told me to work hard af
And if you break the unspoken rules you die
thats kind of how it is in my family
<:peepocry:640363747990306827> <@!303002872646467596>
the trauma tht comes from azn parenting is imo unparalled
but i think ive been scared into doing absolutely nothing
Then again other british folks in my school had parents that just didn't care and partied with them
flex is being able to ask parents for hw help growing up
Ok i think i finally can fall asleep now
But there was still always an *unspoken* expectation
I have enough depressing things to thibk about to cry myself to sleep
Good night
night!

its rare to find someone actually looking for a relationship
You better be asleep.

uh oh i got 44 likes it‚Äôs been 5 minutes

gorl power
NO NO NO ||DICK PICS||
simps be out
and creeps
What is happening
there will be some
trust
its unavoidable on that app
Imagine getting matches on tinder. Couldn't be me.
I don't get why guys think girls want to stare at their penises.
_I_ don't want to stare at my penis.
because people are horny
Some people use the app as a hookup service
most*
thats why I gave up on dating apps lmao
Go to a cafe
good on the people who found someone
ok time to delete tinder then

Hi Nathan

"IS THIS UR HYDRO?"

I GOT ON THE SCOOTER
AND YEETED
I don‚Äôt remember the first thing I‚Äôve said the jeff

i want me some boba now ugh why
*pretends to yeet it at him*
u should have
~~I only remember the creaming incident~~
the what
him: WAIT N-
I used Tinder for a little bit because I wanted a relationship and was feeling too impatient to let one happen naturally
ngl nina it was a lot of work for me to get out of bed to come claim my hydro
Needless to say I didn't get anything from it
natural relationships or bust
<@!242544930528952321> omw with boba
U WENT TO ROSES APT i thought tht was so funnie
i'll slide in ur dms w boba this time

I‚Äôve never used dating apps
im too smooth brain to understand that <@!206933072078307328>
tinder > bumble in terms of cute ppl
facts
it just means facts
oh

Unless that memey bro app counts
Tinder just has more people in general
thats just me being boomer then
But I was catfishing

o
i think you are really good looking chris
That's a great song, respect
so it's a completely different environment
ok back to the convo
300 miles radius
Nice
1000miles radius to ucsd
<a:weeHypers:716841972668563456> i started strong and then idk what happened
it do be a catchy song
i never set my radius above like......................... 15 miles
unless i was Really Bored
Imagine being good looking
but the 16 mile cuties
i caught the ugly
couldnt be me
agreed
Cant relate
smh david
<@!151123898698563584> thinks im ugly
> i never set my radius above like......................... 15 miles
<@242544930528952321> yeah i didn't like making my radius more than 50
I‚Äôm ugly as fuck
mood
social construct
I'm
Ugly is subjective
cannot relate attractiveness -> romantic relationships
you know how theres never hot singles in your area
ugly is my best subject
maybe thats because *you're the hot single*
üëÄ
Lies
aw
well at least im neither of those things
amen
I‚Äôm not a hot single
i'm just single
im bad at conversation
are you an ugly taken
yes
same
<@!151123898698563584>
Yes Nathan
Im just ugly
wait andy you're
*no*
o. o
wait
HMM
i. i can't call myself ugly anymore bc i don't believe it anymore
i only do it on my absolute worst days
<@!242544930528952321>  wat
i still believe it in somewhat but also at the same time i just say it because i want jeff to give me attention
we stan self confidence
<@!151123898698563584> im UGLY
oh also when my skin is acting up bc i hate my textured skin
t e x t u r e d
> <@!151123898698563584> im UGLY
<@242544930528952321> lie one more time i dare u
social construct tho, nobody is rly ugly
I've been stuck with acne and I kinda just hope it blends in with my freckles at this point
i am tho
LMAO
jeff what iin the fuck
maybe you'll grow out of it soon <@!175792267590762496>
acne should be more normalized along with other skin conditions
meanwhile i havent had acne all my life until now
why is everyone awake...
i fucking hate hearing ppl putting others down for their SKIN
tea methinks
> why is everyone awake...
<@151123898698563584> mind ur business jeff
period
But because some people can get rid of it, it raises the ceiling for 'beauty', which in turn raises peoples' expectations
nina where is our

Good nighto Aedan !
hello! im class of '24 and i was a little confused on how to declare a minor? i wanted to minor in computer science but i wasnt sure when/how to declare it? thank you!
<@!711817625394741359> hi! if you go onto your triton link there's an option under advising and grades that says Major & Minor, and that's where you would do it!

thank you!!!
np np it should tell you what you need to do but essentially have courses you plan to take that fulfill the minor requirements ready
and plug all that in

OO happy birthday!! <@!247048961213333505>
<@!247048961213333505> I congratulate you on the anniversary of the day you were exiled from your mothers vagina and had to face the cold reality that is life.
Eat lots of cake
The cake dulls the pain of existence with its sweet flavor
I got a message like that this morning but they said that I was banished from the puss
Equally as enjoyable
Damn someone stole my line
The phrasing is different enough
TURNITIN wouldn‚Äôt flag you, so you‚Äôre good
I appreciate it nonetheless

wait then whats <#468564713593241600> for
<#468564713593241600> is for help regarding material
just me venting lmao - i‚Äôm at a 89.999999% rn in her class and i‚Äôve got no idea what her curve is like and if i get an A pre-final then I don‚Äôt need to take her final
techinical questions
riiiip
riiip
hope you figure it out aneesh <:hypers:471374617337135134>
yes i hope you find what youre looking for
I have no idea because curves differ depending on the professor. From what I understand though, 6C generally offers a good curve since everyone dies.
ye ye thanks mate
here‚Äôs to praying she doesn‚Äôt fuck us over and give a generous curve
Pray that your professor is feeling generous with everything that's going on too.
She‚Äôs anything BUT generous
I'm at a 90% on one of my classes and to get an A (versus A-) is a 93%. I'm not sure if MATH 11 curves can make magic happen though
How is she has a teacher?
Not really that good, her lectures don‚Äôt make a lotta sense (and she just ripped podcasts from previous years and threw them in for the remote lectures this year so we have to listen to a blaring ‚ÄúGOOD MORNING CHILDREN‚Äù in every lecture), midterms are relatively hard-ish

took her for 6B tho, and it was kinda easy and manageable, and she did give a generous curve bc of the sudden change in situation. but i doubt she‚Äôll have a similar change of heart rn
i‚Äôve been tryna get into math 11 but looks like i‚Äôll have to do it in winter üòî
who are you taking it with?
I'm taking it with Bach but I just found out yesterday that this was his first time teaching the course. I don't know about other professors but I generally think they're all nasty. The course is just nasty.
It's a 5-unit course that requires a lot out of you so it's been very challenging with remote learning. Although I do not doubt his knowledge, it must be said that he has a thick asian accent that could be a problem to some.
<:sweat:713285695694831647>
Bach‚Äôs pretty good i think
Ive never taken a class with him but without his lectures i prob wont be able to pass my class
What class?
20C
<#443278526800723978> ?
i love bach w all my heart hes such a funny guy but imo he canot teach
i veyr much do not vibe w his teaching style
I don't attend his lectures shhh
it feels too scattered for me personally
<:sweat:713285695694831647>
i am a very linear stupid
as in im stupid and u needa draw the line explicitly
or else i will get lost
I get u about being too scattered tho
If someone in this channel is taking MATH 11 with Bach, can you please fill out your CAPES? We only need 1 more person to get the lowest lab removed uwu
move this to <#443278526800723978> maybe?
just a suggestion
Some profs tend to tangent off to **literally** everything else <:peepocry:640363747990306827>
i mena ttalk can also hold school stuff
you say Bach and i think of the baroque composer <:wsVsU7mxSU2FdfU5NtpgQA_thumb_470:688600982212706336>

covid angst is if u dont want it to get drowned out

Like this stuff showed up in the chinese community like ages ago but ive never seen an english equivalent until recently
<:wotthink:441465363671154698>
i remember when simp didn't mean someone that worshiped women or put them on a pedastal

we never had simp in hs
yeah we did
what did we have in hs
i only heard it in college

i don‚Äôt think i listen to sad music when i‚Äôm sad
s i m p l y simp
i said WE randy not you
or at least i did
i listen to sad music bc they‚Äôre nice to sing to NCOA BC KA
like my hs
never used simp
main def now is i would say still generally pathetically pining after someone but if you use it verb-wise ppl get what you mean and it still falls under sad/complaining
i only heard the term after college
you say we as in a generation

*mama mia*
here we go again!
SPAISU GAARU
Reo Speedwagon is p good when it comes to classic rock
more of a low key kinda vibe rather than a super upbeat i think
but i havent heard many of his songs so idrk
have you guys heard your latest trick by dire straits?
If you're looking for classic rock, I'm gonna suggest The Who
yess
the who
havent heard much of their stuff tho
not super classic but Radiohead
is my fucking jam
i know like one song
Also, Paranoid and Master of Reality by Black Sabbath are both great albums
their early work isn't super like "metal" or whatever, it's more like heavy rock
ohh yea i love paranoid
havent listened to master of reality tho
so if even if you aren't big into metal, I recommend those albums
is paranoid super metal?
it feels more like rock
Yeah, by today's standards it sounds more like rock
but at the time, it was kinda out there
fair enough
> Miggy stop thinking about me it‚Äôs showing in your typos
<@!245736329382461440>  WAIT I DIDNT EVEN NOTICE I TYPED YOUR NAME IN THAT HOLY SHIT
true metal is like insane tho
like damn their vocal chords
hella impressive
oh yeah, it's a feat
I feel like metal is the last genre with real "virtuoso" musicians
> i asked my grandma why she didn‚Äôt like the beatles and she said ‚Äúmen are ugly, like ABBA is prettier‚Äù JCKANDJS
<@!652073170890915864> runs in the family
CBAOJDAJ
ur dad: <:yeet:442868651792793601>
yea electronic is great and takes skill as well but something about real instruments is just like
idk how to explain it
but Pink Floyds dark side of the moon
took music production to a whole new level
and they had like no computers or anything
so making those sounds were just incredible
yall should listen to the album if you havent already
pure genius
but you gotta listen from beginning to end
none of that shuffle nonsense
its really an incredible album that is basically just 2 really long songs
oh also probably self explanatory
but I enjoyed Dark Side of The Moon the most while uhh
pharmaceuticals
not like at a rave tho
like the uhh fungus kind
not condoning drug use
be responsible kids
but by itself it is already an incredible album
but yea look up acid rock
it is an incredible subgenre of rock that really tests the creative limits of music

Lettuce clubs started at some other university as a secret club right?

i still dont get the point of lettuce club
They met once a year

And ate lettuce
its a money laundering scheme
i also remember hearing about lettuce club during freshman year

It‚Äôs because we are near the city precinct

actually i can get an A- if i get above a 82 ish <:thonk:440231969796784128>
<:sad_dab:613867302701760542>
henry im assuming we can get a 90 on hw6 or 7
<:pain:713285895419330591>
üôÇ
cuz our 77.5 is killing us lOL
some heavy hw calculations going on
actually a tutor made us a nice final grade calculator for our class
so that was really cool
and we stan
If only we put as much brain power into the final as we do into calculating what grade we need
TRUE
<@!144994874570047488> havent you been roasted for this before
calculating your grade instead of studying
<a:hahakek:676470025317777484>
<:kek:490008924414803968>
yeah he has
yea
math 183
stonk
Grade calculations is both fun and terrifying.
I can get a guaranteed A at 93% (I'm at 90% I think) but that would mean getting a 92% on the final
I love calculating my grades over and over
<a:pepeHandRub:588066901784002733>
I think I'll just take the A- and save me pain and suffering from attempting to get through a final
I know I have 1 A and one A+ in the bag thanks to the whole situation
Meanwhile my genetics class is not making finals optional but I need to ace that to get an A
But the rest are a grade calculating nightmare
A+ dont mean much tho but flexing :((
<:FeelsBadMan:441463646124507136>
I know
I wish it did
I wish it gave an extra grade boost or something
I have a guaranteed A and a highly probable A
A- guaranteed, A maybe if 90% --> 93% needed for an A from curve??
And genetics is just silly hehexd
An A in one of my classes is 80%
i WISH
But thats because the midterm averages were 70% before all this started
Let alone
Now
damn
Oh nope, looks like its still a 70% average for the midterm/final
> I love calculating my grades over and over
<@!181482518107783168>  does that not stress you out
But she did go to multiple choice
im really sad for one of my classes.  went from a 97% to a 94% cause of one midterm
Yes <@!219584106550263809>
But I also love to know all my outcomes
that resulted from stupid small mistakes despite knowing 100% of the material reeeee
I felt that
I stopped doing that because it stresses me the fuck out
I've done that in some classes <@!186011132325003264>
Knowing exactly what i need to pass
I just dont check my grade till the end
it's over
So it doesnt mess up my energy
I am stressed about MCWP I'll say that
<a:pepekms:689625546698915962>
<:PepeKMS:580487942259212288>
I have no idea what my grade will be
<:pepeKMS:716112758243983453>
I got a B/B+ in one assignment
But thats the ONLY thing we have graded
<:sweats:664643494995820554>
Not the remaining 80% or whatever of our grade
I could get a C+
Or an A+
Who knows
Can't even calculate it
<:PepeKMS:580487942259212288>
<@!314229461396488195> Wat happn

O
<:PepeKMS:580487942259212288>
For which class
i was so closed to fixing it then, 11:59 happened
whats bash
:(
Unix shell
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
<:PepeKMS:580487942259212288>
time to go play urf until i am forced to take my 12 final
15l
sam
it was 15l
Bash is really good for simple stuff but is ultimately C
And Python can do more than Bash
they made us count the characters of each line and sort them into an array
then output it
<:PepeKMS:580487942259212288>
<:ew:619334178357641237>
i dont know bash syntax so that's what i got stuck on
90% of the time
On their Linux systems or the ancient version OSX uses?
ssh in their system
Ah so Linux / Windows
GPLv3 probs
<:PepeKMS:580487942259212288>
i hate bash language so much
<:pepeKMS:716112758243983453>
time to go make some chicken
breast
in the oven
Just remember at the end of the day
C
*I agree with Gary on at least that*

Does anyone listen to music to go to sleep? ü§î
Not like whale sounds or heavy rain sounds or whatever  but like if you can‚Äôt sleep so you listen to music ü§î
i play it
quietly
w out lyrics
sometimes
Ooo ok
When I was younger i did that
I tried that
I even downloaded that one app that lets you modify sounds or like stories
to fall asleep
did not work
but thats just because insomnia
i doo!!
that what my insomnia playlist for lmaoo
but also ambient sounds are really nice to listen to as well
^ ive tried music with earphones on and on speakers
earphones for me seem to work better
i don‚Äôt ever want to talk to andrew again
o
u guys listen to music to sleep
he stands for everything i‚Äôm against
i watch bon appetit .....
o
You think that's weird? My sister watches forensic files
i used to watch criminal minds to sleepüëÅüëÑüëÅ so similar ig
and then i stopped bc i got sm nightmares LMAO
Lol
I took melatonin but I'm still not sleepy <:PEPESCREAM:466446495747670027>
I feel that would be me if I took melatonin
Rn
Aight imma try sleep
Gn everyone
nightt!
Night luke <a:weeHypers:695830734509834281>
I knew someone who watched surgery videos while eating.
my sister went to sleep on the couch so for the last 3(?) hours, her perfume has been making me mildly nauseous <:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
Kill.
lol
im also just particularly nose sensitive to like, aerosols and certain scents
On second thought, death doesn‚Äôt remove perfume but will replace it with citrusy decomposition.
Mmmm..
well im going to be now, so its over
but ye, perfumes and stuff are common at parties, so thats another reason i dont like parties
I don‚Äôt get perfume at the parties I attend.
was that necessary to say? idk, its the truth, i might be crackhead hours talking
I should stop telling myself i dont like parties/am not social tho
Cuz that just leads to confirmation bias and self fulfilling prophecy
Y‚Äôall ever been too sad to sleep but you don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre sad? <:cryangry:606031757099401217>
F
Depression is stinky.
^
I do be sad but 95% of the ttime I know why im sad
but I don't know how to make myself unsad
partner make sad unsad
whats a partner ? <:thonK:500668461501120525>
never heard of those

I think partner means like a dog or cat or some type of pet ü§î

hmmm doesn't seem so <:thonK:500668461501120525>

Why do modern Ferrari's idle so damn loud
I can hear it in my room
<:cursecat:612044490307272727>
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
This guy needs to move his car out of muh street
Or I'll send the SubarBRO out
Actually I don't want to do that his WRX is horrifyingly loud
ain't nothing wrong with a loud exhaust
but like
people can get exhaust cutouts
to close off the valves when they drive through residentials
so they don't end up annoying people
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
Most cars have that now for emissions
that, and some new cars like the mustang GT have active exhaust
which basically is that
I hate BMW for nerfing my car
The exhaust is shut in drive no matter what because of CA emissions
active exhaust/active exhaust doesnt nerf your car
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
because you can just open the valves
lol
Not anymore I can't
why?
Its the same with the optional Camaro exhaust
CA emissions
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
Its open in Park or Reverse
Which is big dumb
i have an SS dude
2021 MY
but lucky mine is a 2013
so none of that BULLSHIT
But in the case of BMW they nerfed older cars
Via OTA
i mean you can probably just tune that out tho
it isnt the end of the world
remove the shit and tune whatever makes it do that out of the computer
It isn't on the same system as the ECU so its pretty easy
ECU tuning is a big no thanks
exactly
so just do that
Too hard
I do but its smart
And resets
just go to a tuner
Same deal bruh
that might know a better way
can you remove the part itself?
that closes off your valves
Yeah you can just open the electronic actuator, but then it gets hella loud
I actually like it quiet in Comfort
Or Eco
welp
At least I didn't get a 2020MY
idk then chief
id never it in comfort, so id probably just remove it
Where they coded out all the throatiness
with those settings, id constantly have it in track
lmfao
I need comfort to get my 42 highway
Lmao
maan
what bmw do you have?
2019 330i pre/engine tweaks
aint nobody got time for gas mileage
buy a civic for that
üòÇ
I'm paying for it now so you bet I got time for it lmao
lmao
If I was back in Texas sure
yeah, i understand
Where its what
1.50$?
A gallon
WTF
For 93
ive never seen those gas prices
in my entire life
Prices collapsed nationwide bruh
ive always been in cali
yeah ik
It was like 1$ for a bit in some places
but never to that
amount
here
LOL
yurr
cheapest i saw was $2.86 in davisd
Cheapest I saw here was 2.89$ for 91 in Convoy
and i thought that was mega cheap for here
$2.86 for 91
But that lasted for maybe
3-4 days
LOL
it be like that chief
well, on the inverse of this
Only good news is thanks to COVID my cars costing me basically nothing
imma get a corsa Xtreme catback soon
so my shit's gonna sound hella good
Insurance is about 120$ a month before COVID rebates right now
Its comfy
gotta get that with AFM tune
Given I'm fully insured as an only driver at 21
<a:pepeHandRub:588066901784002733>
mhmm
yeah, insurance is not bad on those lol
When I saw my car was cheaper to insure than a new Camry
I loled
once u get to 400+ bhp stock is when it gets expensive
for young drivers
Nobody seems to be crashing this new gen
Compared to the F30 anyway
well thats good
my friend, do you use your turn signals?
Naturally
good man
And lord if I didn't the car wouldn't have it
dont be a typical bmw driver
u did good, son
The lane departure assist is fairly aggressive
Because its an active system that will avoid other cars in accidents
thats probably why less of them are being crashed
Highly likely
the computer helps you drive in that thing
I'm all for two things
autonomous braking, and blind spot monitors
That and maybe a rear view camera
The rest can shove it
blind spot monitors, for sure
the breaking, yeah it's cool
I ain't gonna use no 3D surround camera
but i feel like it takes away from the drivers' experience
if you want a true drivers' car
Auto braking is just for crashes lmao
nothing wrong with it for a normal car
yeah, for situations like that for sure
Plus in BMWs its nice
if it just breaks when youre about to hit something
I push one button
that would be nice
Everything off
Thats how all the systems work
but if it always hits the breaks for u when u let off the gas
like teslas do
Its basically mandated by the feds now
i dont like that
Oh thats for regen
i saw bmw
who wants to be murdered by a diesel bmw
My car will do that but only if you are going downhill
So you stay at a steady speed
To charge my battery
teslas do that because of their theory for making the most efficient use of energy. when u let off the gas, it breaks, then takes all of that energy and puts it back into the battery
Yes
it's a cool theory
oh no a car person
You can just turn it off
porsche does it the opposite way though
Which is what I did when I drove a Model 3
<a:monkaShoot:699841146943176734>
they prefer letting it course through
<#479753772323700746>
you hoes
they think thats more efficient
WHOMSZT
Porsche let you choose between coasting regen and braking regen or both in the Taycan
Heavy braking regen is the best
oh really? i thought it just lets you coast
Which is what Audi also use
i saw matt farah's review on it and thats what he said
No you get 20-21% extra braking force
On top of the what 10 piston calipers
Lmao
interesting
Shared with the Urus
and holy shit, yeah those are big
And other VW products
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
makes sense tho with the torque on those things

wait ur
sometimes ppl assume im chinese bc of my last name

my chinese teacher did AHAHAH
i don't think anyone ever assumed i was viet
until <@!151123898698563584>  ngl
like my tagline states
i am mostly jungly jungle asian
i didn't rlly consider myself part chinese for my whole life
jeff
i just said
it's still hard to call myself part chinese now
i assumed u were a balloon
yea and i assumed you were a dumb bi-
ay you dummies stop fighting
chickens, pls

what longboi said
i said nothin
hey i'm just stating the facts here
but the facts
yo thats my line
we do not claim our colonizers
the french?
the chinese too
the zulus
unless my history be wrong
thems too
tfw ur dad's side is chinese and u felt weird being associated with them bc u didn't know the language 4 19 yrs
someone said ho chi minh
i was tryna go there this year
here we go
but then rona struck
and ?
i thought u were gna make a vn war joke
no lol
which i am sick of LMAO
tyty
thank god
np
yeah, i was actually learning viet for a while this year and last year
anyway why vn in particular?
on duolingo
anh biet noi nhieu chua?
im not viet myself but im interested in the place and culture
so i wanted to visit
i know it's beautiful there
how much can i converse with ya then 0:
hmm
that's p cool! also like what got u interested in vn in the first place
i understood i few of those words
on a scale from one to ten i am in the second grade
biet means speak
noi is like language
know*
anh is like he
yeah, know
yeeee
my bad
im a little rusty
no worries
havent done my lessons in a couple months
been doing japanese lately
hmmm do diacritics help?
the think with duo is that
oh wow 0:
the viet course is pretty bad for learning how to speak
for reading and writing it's pretty good
i learned a lot while i was doing it daily
but the words are so hard to pronounce for a non-native speaker
gotchu, idr if duo had pronunciations?
and they dont do a very good at teaching you that
they do pronounce the words
it's just very bad
it's like an extremely bad northern accent
ur right on with tht, it's p hard
tbf the five different tones dont help very much either
^^^^
it's because of the intonations
yeah
i grew up speaking viet and im still terrible
to my knowledge only viet and chinsese has those
english is such a monotonous lang
and it's very hard
so switching from tht to viet is def a challenge
bro if u pronounce the word for rice
with a slightly different tone
u end up saying cum
imagine going to a restaurant in ho chi minh and ordering a bowl of cum
lmfao
thats what scares me about it
i have to be spot on
the joke would fly over viet ppl's heads trust me
or people wont know wtf im saying
they'd just think u were pronouncing it wrong
which
case in point
true
but still
for more complicated sentences, i feel that having an accent will make it hard to communicate with the actual people who natively know the language
so it takes a lot of practice
since you asked, part of my motivation for going there this summer was to learn the language better
would u say u have a northern accent then
since i was super on that
uhh
i might
since i learned from duo
and it uses a northern accent
albeit, a very bad one
tht's the most common when nonnative speakers learn but idk why tbh
idk either
i dunno much abt linguistics to say AHAHA
haha
it's all good
we love language immersion
i find it funny that japanese is like an exact inverse of viet, in that the speaking to me is really freaking easy, but the writing is balls deep hard
but im super intrigued bc highkey i always hear abt non azn ppl wanting to learn korean or japanese
but never viet
while in viet, the writing to me isnt really hard at all with some practice, but the speaking is so hard
so i was v pleasantly surprised
yeah
i wanted to learn viet before japanese
but i stopped cuz the duo doesnt teach speaking very well
yeah understandable! the grammar is on par with chinese, simple enough but the tones will trip ya up
i think in general, it's best to learn the language in the actual country
or with people who speak
if i was viet, it would be way easier since id have family who speak it
but it's ok
i'll get back to it eventually
lmk if u ever need a speaking partner! hmu in one of the voice channels n we can chat
sure!
im down
> if i was viet, it would be way easier since id have family who speak it
waiiiit dope
would have to practice some duolingo lessons for a bit
to get warmed up
haha ofc, no rush; honestly this summer is gna be p chill
summer seshes aside xd
i agree dude
im not doing any summer sesh since im a new transfer here
but my whole 2019 was hell
did fam motivate u to learn viet?
so this is all rest and relaxation
bc for me i learned mandarin to communicate with my dad's fam better
nah, like i said, im not vietnamese. im persian
i just felt like learning it
my fam are only persian
wait i read wrong
no worries
yeah, my second language is farsi
> if i was viet, it would be way easier since id have family who speak it
<@!85061459670740992> misread thinking u had fam who spoke viet sfkjhfjs
i cant read or write, but im fluent speaking
It's all good
tht's p dope
ye
i love farsi cuz so many people dont know it so
with another farsi speaker, it's like having a secret language
i think knowing a second lang is one of the best skills to have
outside
i absolutely agree
love tht notion, codespeak, if u will
yessir!
and i think polyglots r so fucking cool LMAO wish i had more time to learn languages
but ya
spanish is so useful, tht's a lang i wish i picked up
pretty much all of my mom's siblings know 5 or more languages
so i want to know a few too
i want to learn japanese, german and viet
and maybe like french after that
and spanish... cuz it's spanish
german is a cool sounding language
i took 3 years of it in hs but i dont know shit lmao
wait ario hollup lemme show up sth
sure
check <#650931041334460433> it's one of my fave tiktoks bc 4 languages included
kk
the german guy LMFAO
SENDSSS
i love german hahaha üòÇ
there's a pt 2 tht's also funny asf
i love how sharp it sounds
it is definitely a very rough language
a language pet peeve i have: when ppl say langs sound ugly
and i personally think it's the toughest of the european languages to learn how to write in
like bruh????????????
there are so many freaking rules
yeah
i feel that
ooof grammar rules as bad as english?
my mom didnt like the sound of viet when i was learning it
but i was like
bruh stop
just let me learn
WHERE IS YEN
i take such offense when ppl say viet sounds bad like um
<@!245736329382461440>
<@!245736329382461440> hiii
also i think the grammar rules are worse in german than english
and yeah, i understand
that would annoy me too
oh damn big rip
if people said it about farsi
which is why i dont say those things
i also dont think it sounds ugly
it's just freaking hard to pronounce some of the words
because a different tone means totally different word half the time
and like, the alphabet isnt that big, so there are a lot of similarities in sounds
AND TOLD THE G TO SOMETIMES SOUND LIKE A Z
LIKE BRO
to me, yeah i get it viet can be harsh but tht's just bc we're blaring them at 90 dB outta our mouths
fax no printer
BAHAHAHAHAHHAHA i feel ari
yeah
there's no quiet way to speak viet
lmao
yesss dino
it's just so fast too bruh
like i really like the model
the best way is to TALK LLLAAAAAHKE THIIIS
named Ng·ªçc Trinh
model of farsi or viet?
But like
OH actual model
SOMETIMESYOUJUSTGOTTASTARTTALKINGLIKETHISINVIET

i wonder what happend to xuan mai
idk her
she went down p badly >:
i just know trinh and a couple others
:(((
xuan mai was like the golden child on 2000s viet
had concerts and all that to teach kids viet when she was a kid too
prob made hella bank
thats hella dope
oh she's nguoi nam!
she went to bolsa?????
lakjsdhfiwufehlkasjdhf

LMAOOOO ALL MY INTL FRIEND FOLLOW HER
yuh
T√¥i mu·ªën b√°nh m√¨

the extent of my powers

üòÇ
FROM MUELLER
AH YES HE CALLED ME
it was a wholesome call
toi cung muon banh mi luon
iconic
what is cung and luon
i love how he thinks of us when he's drunk
aw mueller
cung = also, luon is like as well
i miss him <:pepehands:464568955533524992>
like they go in a pair
ah i see
makes sense
wait do diacritics help u
what are diacritics
he said some really nice things i was like <:peepocry:640363747990306827>
sybols
dee symbols ehe
oh, all the accents?
yuhh
i mean, they kinda complicate things a little but
it's not hard to memorize which word gets what
i think the would help A LOT more if duolingo actually taught you
which diacritic symbol goes with
what sound
because they dont ever teach you that
they just throw words at you
and it's up to you to figure it out
ario th√≠ch ƒÉn moÃÅn vi√™Ã£t g√¨?
by memorizing what words have what sounds
hmm i wonder wht ur name would be in viet
T√¥i th√≠ch ph·ªü v√† c∆°m
And beef bowls
Beef or chicken bowls at Viet places are good
Also the tea

youre starting to sound like a boomer

my 1-2 years over u already makes me a boomer
:^)
maybe
whomst
w h o m s t
what classes are you taking next quarter <@!85061459670740992>
h  o e m s t
idk yet
gotta talk to my counselor once the registration for classes starts
or a little before that i guess
rn im just tryna get my financial aid, housing, and transcript stuff secured
the neuros unite
neubros
FACTS
NEURBROS
i imagine i'll have to take o-chem
but honestly
if i can avoid taking it my first semester here
I WOULD LIKE THAT
o-chem is not a class u want to be taking when youre getting acclimated to a place
but probably gotta take it
so idk
im not a chem major because of ochem
^
fuck o-chem
ochems easy
why do i gotta do this shit for neuro
and med school
oChEmS eASy
leave me alone!!!
says chem major
tutor me then <@!210429883665481730>
what makes you think I'm a chem major
<:xd:612726759846051861>
xd
i'll give u that BREAD
:]
i bought organic as a second language
just to read ahead of time
who to you recommend at sd for o-chem <@!210429883665481730>
preferably not a hard-ass teacher that makes the class harder than it already is
> ochems easy
<@!210429883665481730> tell that to hoeger
I can tell you not to take oconnor
got it
Hoeger is good
wait I saw neuro heLlLo
hola
hoeger good
just a lil crazy though
is he chill or?
he likes anime
oconnor rambles and goes on very long tangents
i prefer a chill teacher whos laid back
OH YESSIR
WE'D GET ALONG
he's chill but also demands a lot from his students
can be very intimidating no bs type prof
imma peep his ratemyprofessor

if you're on confessions of the meme page he pops up a decent amount
lmfao
the search
dude has a solid 4/5
not bad i guess

thats fair for an o-chem class
but it depends on what "heavily" means to this person
most ochem classes have a thiccccccccccc curve
if you got 100/150 on the midterms you're set for at least a B+
imagine getting a B
you wanna know what happened with the class i dropped in the spring?
in a class
<:pepehands:464568955533524992>
our teacher literally passed away
week 3
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
had like no one for a week
then a really hard-ass teacher took over
promised heavy curves because of all the chaos
and how behind we got from his own class
and then
we curved our exam
8 points
out of 128 total points
that is not a heavy curve
so, to me, it depends on what heavy means to these people
have you taken an ochem course before??
or nah
yes
Neurbros for life. I need to get that book to read.
i took first semester twice
and keep in mind it's semester not quarter
it's kinda like a chem curve but on drugs
hi nathan :oooooooo
<a:catHello:704415151683534878>
had to drop it the first time for reasons that were outside my control
like a midterm average would be less than 50%
second try i didnt try much in the spring
The book is $40??
didnt like where my grade was at
and covid happened
and my teacher died
literally
so i dropped again
oof
ochem on a quarter system sucks major ass
but you get it done and over with
so ive been exposed to a lot of the material
honestly, i like the quarter system tho
it doesnt drag on
you just put all your effort in for a short burst of time
and get it done
and the amount of material that u cover in a quarter is less
yeeeee
i probably
literally
know all of the first quarter's material
and just have to refresh
and really refine it
this time around
which is why i bought the second language book to read over the summer
you'll probably do decently
im not playing around this time
hopefully
i really do not like labs
i think the hardest thing for me was just memorizing all of the mechanisms
and resonance forms
but lab and lecture are separate classes at UC's, right?
Which book did you get specifically?
and yes, definitely
for my old class or the second language book?
yeah lab and lecture are separate
Second language.
that is fantastic
i'll show you
I'm taking ochem this upcoming quarter :))))

aye man, who u taking it with?
we can take the same one
gl boys
im tryna choose whoever is the chillest and best one
available
don't cry *too* much
When is your enrollment?
and preferable NOT an early morning class
idk yet bro
i dont know how it works for transfers
I have it with Albizati. I'll send the course section.
I have no idea how transfers work too.
i heard hes good but
let's all take 43a together !
I'll see you next year or during summer for that.
unless ur doing it all fall then nvm
i read his rate my professor and some things concerned me
im doing it in fall zoey
I'm taking 40A
not fully registered yet to take a summer class
43A fall? wHY
cuz im a transfer
thats the soonest i can take classes
plus, i dont want to take a summer class rn
i want to rest
albizatiiiiiii
my guyyy
I chose Albizati over Hoeger because I heard the latter's ability to teach during the online format has been completely horrific.
prof for it fall has bad reviews, also not fan of remote lab
i have albizati rn and the guy is a g
so that's why i decided against it
For class?

He's a really chill professor. I wish I could see him shoot hoops like before.

wait he was actually
trash
these reviews kinda concerned me
in chem 6a
but i heard he's good at 40a
soo
gen chem i heard he's not good
but ochem he is
yeah, people say hes a bad gen chem teacher
yea i didnt like him in chem 6a
all selfteach
thats the case for a lot of o-chem profs tbh
i have him for 40b
he's also an industry guy
so he works a lot more with the ochem stuff in general
It's too late now I suppose. I had a positive experience with him for 6A.
wait when did u take 6a with him
Winter first year
you should be good nathan
wait
bruh same
bruh
bruh
is ternansky any good?
his tests are
decent
Remember when that scooter started blaring in the middle of class?
not fun
LOL
is what ive heard
Ternansky is good for premed students I've heard.
i think hes the one you told me to avoid <@!251234796670418946>
he rly spent time to shoot hoops
i think he went crazy during a lecture once though
ternansky radiates old man energy
is he the 35% midterm average one?
yes
fuck that then
never mind
hoooop
i had him for 40b and NOPED
Shooting hoops with his lecture notes <:PatrickGasm:600914637940326400>
NOPE
^^
thats most ochem classes thoughhh
miss me with that
> Remember when that scooter started blaring in the middle of class?
<@!186011132325003264> 6b?
6A Albizati
your class it is <@!186011132325003264>
pardon, 6a
40A albizati
i had 6b with young
NOO
SAME
I DID NOT LIKE
YOUNG
albizati is a homie
can confirm
brydges ftw
had him for 6a
a true lad
albizati is hella cool
Young was a horrible teacher. Too be fair he's fairly new back then.
also bussey
But I had to self-teach mostly.
wtfff ok i just didnt like him for 6a
fml
I had Hoeger for 6C and I survived so do I get a t-shirt?
yall should see his kids in the background of his zoom lectures
hella funny
his midterm and final was so str8forward
yesssss he always changed the bkgrds
sho cute
no guys, debelouchina for 6c
best prof
sweetest prof
That final at the gym was lowkey horrifying. I had SAT flashbacks <@!151123898698563584>
YES
SAME
i had hoeger for chem 4 and he was all bark lil bite
AP TESTING PTSD TOO
<:shookhamster:606593747010060326>
omfg
i saw ap testing
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
Debelouchina is an actual name?
imagine needing to take ochem
https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1846849 https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=2131837 https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=2417219 what about these profs?
they have really good feedback
bertrand also a lowkey homie
she's the most caring gen chem prof I've ever had i loved her
I have never heard of them. I heard Bertrand was.. interesting but nice?
i havent heard anything about the others
are these guys teaching in the fall?
and dang
why these guys so unknown?
A SCAM
> i saw ap testing
<@!314229461396488195>
tb to when i took 7 ap tests senior yr and only like 2 of them helped for ucsd credits
it is a scam
O'Conner, Hoeger, and Albizati are teaching this upcoming fall.
somehow iw as able . to take ap tests for $5 a test
<a:ohohoho:636686946734964786>
also only helps for enrollment times
they're probably only part-time lecturers
i see
the ones everyone knows lecture all year
so out of those, you guys recommend albizati?
yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
okay, his class it is then
hopefully i get it
i will waitlist that shit if i have to
I wish I could've taken the neurobiology lab this quarter but it literally conflicted with my entire schedule of classes.
that sucks
everything is like
TuThu
at the WORST times
what is the minimum amount of classes we have to take?
That's what happens when you throw a 5-hour lab course into the middle of a schedule.
5 hours lab <:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
For financial aid, I think it's 12?
12 units?
ye
12 units or 3 courses
<:Ping:567963841204453386>
that is perfect
3 courses is very healthy
i'll take o-chem with two easy classes
<a:PEPESCREAM:659115134089822288>
i really do not want anything tasking with o-chem
Why did I scroll up
I'm taking PHYS 1A/1AL, CHEM 40A, BIPN 148, and PHIL 28 next quarter <:jesuspepe:567197534548656147>
because
you're an ib
person
don't do mcwp
at the same time
<a:PEPESCREAM:659115134089822288>
I saw the chav
i have to do physics too for my lower division but
soul-sucking.
Impression
<:cursecat:612044490307272727>
idk if i want to do physics
and o chem
hup hup hup
at the same time
<:gun2:607557159768686592>
that sounds like hell bro
pip pip cheerio
which physics?
<a:monkaShoot:699841146943176734>
> Impression
<@!181482518107783168> DISCLAIMER I SAID IT WAS BAD DIDN'T I
is PHIL 28 logic?
1 series ?
wait sorry I'm taking
phil 28 is a writing class
intro to logic
1C/1CL
<a:topKek:538017398419226634>
1 series because why would I ever take the 2 series
if it's like phil 27
anyways
nah, it's ethics
nvm
prof tsai is actually the sweetest guy
i could take that
<a:PEPESCREAM:659115134089822288>
PINGED
ethics n society = phil 28
as an easy class
yeah it's ethics, but basically an extra writing clas
s
I'm taking the majority of the physics courses over summer so I want to finish the series fall <@!85061459670740992>
<a:hahakek:676470025317777484>
I only do logic PHIL classes
it's writing class in disguise
nice
for us warren
Which is why I took PHIL 10
students
i'll talk to my counselor and see what i can do
And now 12
if i want to stay on track
but not be overwhelmed
with the curriculum
If you want to try for an UD neuro course maybe you can take BIPN 148 with me
how many ge classes do u have to do, ario
The key to staying on track
Is closing your eyes
u taking that in the fall?
i could
And pretending
Yeah
thats an option
isn't 148 like
learning
i would actually love to take an actual neuro class for once
BIPN 148 - Cellular Basis of Learning & Memory
and memory ?
all ive done is major prep
I'm assuming lots of LTP stuff
and intro to psych
lmao
NMDA receptors and glutamate and all that
LOL remembered that
let me study the brain for once
fuck
<a:PepePopcorn:554328145344462848>
LTP
It will be
L o n g  t e r m  d e p r e s s i o n
i'll take note of that tho
But thats easy mode tier neuro
so i could take o-chem, that neuro class
Even if we still don't understand much
and ethics
who wants to take bibc with me....
and that would be 3 courses
~~understand anything~~
It's an upper-division class strictly on learning and memory though so it might get into nitty-gritty details.
do i need any prereqs to take it?
Unfortunately, there are not a lot of good BIPN courses offered during fall that isn't basic human physiology <@!85061459670740992>
Ohhhh.. let me check.
You need BIPN 100
Like olfaction, or gustation, the nitty gritty of memory is pretty all over the place
Which is offered hint hint wink wink
is that gen bio?
human physio
Human Physiology I
oh i dont have that
so i need that
is it really hard?
nah
Human Physiology <:ew:619334178357641237>
cuz like, i want something thats low demanding
Action potentials, renal system, heart stuff, neuromuscular junction, all that fun jazz
with o-chem
I just look at brains
ok
<:ew:619334178357641237>
I want to look at more brains.
it's just memorization
Sounds like IB bio
so if u can do that
That's why I needed my fix of neuro
i can do that
I just take random behavioural neuro and neuro psych classes
<a:pepeHandRub:588066901784002733>
just depends on how much
cuz im already gonna be memorizing mechanisms
I don't know any low demanding course but I feel like I'm the person who has taken the most UD neuro classes on this discord so far <:shook:606018427018149889>
So I'll let you know what I find LMAO
I just wish these courses started further along
<a:PEPESCREAM:659115134089822288>
thank you
Like gib me something advanced
keep in touch with me on that
I'll definitely talk about my courses on here to try to get a certain someone to switch majors
*cough* <@!652073170890915864>
lmao
i haven't done a lot, so nathan's good for asking about that LOL. beenn grinding through all the ge's and phys/chem classes
Human Bio
<:ew:619334178357641237>
facts tho
i need to do my physics and o-chem
to finish my lower dvision
lowkey wish i did it at CC
but oh well
I can't stand the general bio or chem requirements
that would be another year or two
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
b4 transfering
Or I'd be right in Neuro
I was a clinical psychology major before switching so I'm still doing my lower division requirements. By the end of the year I would be done though.
im not trying to be decrepit before i go to uni
The lower div Bio courses are so so basic
true
bild 2 is dumb
I did BILD 3 and fell asleep never wanting to touch anything ever again
i didnt rly care for gen bio
tho i took honors
It wasn't even IB
so we got to do our own research
It was GCSE tier at best
As long as you take BIPN 100 that counts for a lot of prereqs already
that was cool
ok then i should def take that
if it's not too hard
> GCSE
Yes
Nathan
üßê
bicd 100?
<a:PepePopcorn:554328145344462848>
Genetics?
genetics is cool
yall take that?
i love that stuff
I'm getting board of Psych classes
I'm taking it right now and dying. Please don't take it with Professor Day
noted
I swear he's going OFF curriculum
i have it with reuther rn and i need a...... 62.5% on the final to get an A in it
i wish i could talk genetics
shit is cool
WHAT
I WISH
nice
so i'd say im doing well
LOL
> i have it with reuther rn and i need a...... 62.5% on the final to get an A in it
<@!251234796670418946> Sounds like Reuther
i love being in that position
What topics are you covering for th efinal
come finals time
mendelian inheritance onwards
please dont say deviations from men- NOOO
oh thats not too bad
oh
how onwards
that was in gen bio
like.. hardy-weinberg/evolutionary genetics
<:ew:619334178357641237>
Oh god
not tooo baaadddd
We didn't even touch upon that.
IB Bio flashbacks
<:sweats:664643494995820554>
we went over that in my gen bio class
We went through mendelian inheritance the first week of class tbh
but not into as much depth as probably a dedicated genetics class would take it
reuther starts off with the central dogma
Mendelian inheritance is definitely basic basic tier
and then goes into mendelian genetics
it is
says it's important to understand the mechanics before understanding inheritance and whatnot
The problem with Professor Day is that he goes through topics with an examples-based learning technique. There is very little traditional teaching and more explaining through examples alone.
<a:PepePopcorn:554328145344462848>
He also didn't go through a lot of the mechanics.
Mendelian deviations
Pedigrees
Linkage
thats annoying
I'm guessing are topics
so who do you recommend?
pedigrees are fun they're like
lil puzzles
<#639954541617348618>
Reuther I suppose.
<a:PepePopcorn:554328145344462848>
Mhm
Thing is
UCSD please gib me something new
<:peepocry:640363747990306827>
What urks me is that I took Day JUST BECAUSE it fit my schedule better time-wise
And now we have asynchronous
I could've gotten an A <:pepehands:464568955533524992>
what time is it?
I swear I might just start taking aerospace courses or something
It's 12:28AM.
i like to avoid early morning classes
if i can
I get bored too easily
thats not too bad
No, it's 12:28AM *right now*
i find it harder to do well in super early classes
Right now early classes are ok *if* they are asynch
i like studying before exams on the same time in additioon to previous studying cuz
Because I can handle an 8am midterm
fresh in brain
and i dont like waking up early
if i take an early class, it better be writing
But I tend to just watch some lectures and go into finals praying to various gods and demons
late(ish) classes also correlate to later final exam times
later final exam dates or just the time in the day?
Works fairly well
Time of day
time of day
cuz if it's just later in the day, then it's perfect
so it's nice
yeah
thats dope
I hope that with the next quarter comes time for me to refresh and start anew on a winning streak like before. I was killing it winter quarter with my work ethic and felt really happy about my life. Then everything changed <:pepehands:464568955533524992>
facts
fresh start boys
i want to stay on top of everything
maybe have a study group or something
only class i prob can't get an A in though is MCWP 50... haha...
if we have the same classes
I hope I can manage all As this quarter. Genetics will be the toughest one (and MATH 11 if I decide to take the final lmao..)
*sad muir noises*
o-chem will def be the toughest for me
Did somebody say
MCWP 50
i would be so happen
to get an A in that
<:pepeKMS:716112758243983453>
so fucjing happy
me
My essay is hot garbage
same
<:fingerguns:654792913917837313>
I can't look at it
it's just
my essays are good
There's always the future quarters. I'd be down to take required neurobiology courses with everyone here.
math and science classes be hard
BIPN 140 is my enemy
And I need to conquer it soon
I write good papers but I wrote this in...a lot shorter of a time than I should have
<:fingerguns:654792913917837313>
draft 3 the day it was due
even then, MCWP is very specific about .... how they want you to write
math make brain hurty
Oh god yes
i never even draft
I hate MCWPs restrictions
i just write them and get A's
We don't have a choice
i cant write with restrictions and prompts
writing is my speciality
my brain doesnt work like that
did you explicitly mention any "warrants"
Normally I just pump out a cute Cogs essay in 30 minutes
yeah i just go for it
i dont need to draft
And get full marks
My warrants uhhh
my draft is just writing the whole thing then proofreading it
bc i didn't andddddddd im worried about my "elements of argument" being docked on the rubric lmao
and fixing things
I kind of went for something
*subtle*
But knowing the rubric i'll get destroyed
i just... did not
At least we don't have to take DOC
<:kek:490008924414803968>
So maybe i'll do that portfolio reflection for some 5% bonus points
dont i have to take DOC?
wait tf? ur TA is doing that?
for marshall
All TAs are
whats the ERC one
Its across the whole program
...... where?
Or at least it should be
Isn't MMW marshall
i didn't see that anywhere
It got announced in my class
After a canvas message from whatever her name is
just "you don't have to do it but you can if you want. it's a good way to wrap up the class"
The actual professor
Yes you get EC
5%
Up to
They'll still grade it and give you the marks for it
I was thinking of pumping out a garbage on tomorrow to at least score 1-2%
???? the only mention of 5% is that it's already given to you instead of having to do it
<:thonk:440231969796784128>
Our grading according to the overall professor is out of a lower total score
What class are y'all talking about? <:coconaSweat:540350619207073832>
And they are just removing it

MCWP 50
my prof said that the 5% is alreaady factored in
hmm
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
Thats different
Wow your TA is formal
My TA is just like
*yo guys*
God I love Jonathan
nah he's chill but he writes emails like that
shoutout to thomas for never roasting me
My TA just writes whatever
I'm emailing my TA in a sec so he can grade my paper before the P/NP deadline
As they are grading them on Tuesday
(at a meeting)
he offered me an extra point to my final grade for doing extra peer reviews for his other section
He said we could so I'm doing it
i was like "uh ok"
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
We don't get that
thanks THOMAS
Because we can't review the other section
We had a form where we had to pick our name
From a list
From Muir Writing
im worried im gonna get screwed over on this final draft and there goes my A..
mcwp 50 just be like that..
Annned
He responded already
Perfect
Honestly
I had a B+ in the Proposal
And don't have a grade for my AB
So I figure an A isn't happening anyway
ur AB isn't graded yet?
Nope
Lmao
hUH
i got an A- on the proposal and A on the AB so i just need to not bomb this paper rn
I got full marks on each section but I didn't do any MLA formatting or whatever LOL
My hatred for MLA was too strong
And I was lazy
LOL MLA is ez points
I haaaate it
I ended up using APA
omg..
A true format
Though the BPS version is even better
<:fingerguns:654792913917837313>
Only way he can probably tell I wrote most of it in two hours
Is that formatting
I was nice and used the correct citation formatting in the AB of course
As that took about 30 seconds
To redo
i hope u get an A on ur AB
i thought i was gonna do bad on mine bc it was .... so long
I should point out I don't even have a Writers Reference
<a:ohohoho:636686946734964786>
Garrett has it
And its an older one anyway
Mine was...
Let me check
4600 words
I CANT FIND RHE PING WTFHSDHAKDBAJXBA
also what is a reverse harem
ooh actually close, mine was 4769 words
Noice
I did the bare minimum 8 citations
yeah same
But I think my paper has...
A lot
20
i think i only have like 3 more or
...
<:fingerguns:654792913917837313>
w ow
Not a record for mew
how do you even use that many tho
like it's a short-ish paper

<a:ohohoho:636686946734964786>
That's a lot of orange.
My citations are
Varied
I ended up hitting like 4400 words and had to hit the brakes
I cut a whole section so I'm at 3600 now
i hit 4050 and had to cut bc word count
painful
I could write the section again but theres no way I can keep it under 4000 and do any justice
im attttt 3788 oops
cutting it close
So I elected to just not bother
> also what is a reverse harem
<@652073170890915864> like a
Whats your paper on
<@!251234796670418946>
Muir gang <@!186011132325003264>
"Improving upon Reforestation Techniques using Fractal Geometry on Trees and Forests" this is my dumb title
O

Uh
*well*
<:fingerguns:654792913917837313>
so that gives a smol idea
Yours sounds fancy
*varied source*
I like
Mine you think is simple then you reach the section that says
*building a global brain*
And shit hits the fan
when a lady be the center of attn in a grp of guys 0: <@652073170890915864>
wait who's asking u this
THE BOI
bc he was asking what mangas i read when i was younger
and i mentioned fruits basket
and he was like
‚Äúomy a reverse harem‚Äù and i was like... wtf is a reverse harem...
LMAOOOFOSKFODSF
Basically my paper builds a giant cognitive system made up of items called Cognizers, which are functional systems made up of humans and digital technology
what's your topic hUh
Uhhhhh
im glad ur keeping up a volley with him tho
Massive Scaled Emergent Cognitive Systems
<:nyello:441469558423814144>
what
<:thinkies:713308987843674153>
ima pretend i didnt see that
The behavioural neruo background is 'the global brain'
Which is a very new term
my research paper doesn't really match my course theme but the TA approved it so i mean
My course theme was cyborgs
it sounded like on of those titles where it's just jargon mashed together to sound technical
<:fingerguns:654792913917837313>
The jargon only gets crazier
Especially when the neuroscience gets involved
my TA keeps commenting how he doesn't know wtf is going on in my paper and how i need to keep in mind that the audience is a fellow MCWP 50 student
^
Same
so I've had to tone down and explain every little *fractal* detail
and im like... just google what a fractal is pls..
I can only survive on the fact that my TA is a comm grad focusing on social systems
That did neuro and psych at undergrad
so much orange
good
<:xd:612726759846051861>
no
if only muir chat channel was this active lol.
^
muir chat hasnt had a msg in
uh
wait where tf is it
oh right
The man with my writers reference appears
<a:ohohoho:636686946734964786>
6 months
hey
<:fingerguns:654792913917837313>
i msged you to pick it up
My fault I know
before the quarter ended
smh
I wasn't around
Not that I needed it
Or maybe I did
making out as if it was my fault smhmh
Guess I'll find out
making it out*
i just use an ugly pdf version of it
so yall finishing up your last drafts?
Yes
i never got any peer review requests from either of you :P
how was mcwp 50
I'm about to proofread it so non neuro/cogs people understand anything I wrote
lmao
Boring
oH, for the visual element, do you *need* to cite a source of how u made it? or if it's completely ur own idea, do you even need a citation?
uh
Either
i think either way you need to cite something
like, they want you to at least incorporate the main source somehow
My TA said it was ok not to if you fabricated it
o ok
even if only in the caption for some explanation
From 'general knowledge'
bc i literally didn't use any source material
Or expected knowledge on a topic
i just was like drew cylinders in google drawing
Theres zero way for me to cite anything for mine
lol
Mine is terrible
And made in Publisher
id say more if i could see it
lmao
Without the caption mine makes not sense at all
i made a chart in google drawing too
bc i get that for graphs and stuff you need to cite the data, right
like, a branch chart or whatever
but I just did like a lil drawing
But I can send the terrible zoomed out version
Yes
so that doesn't require any citation right? bc... what would i even cite...
Nobody I know did charts or graphs
Mostly because we aren't doing data synthesis
well for my branch chart for instance, i basically had some typical "how media (might) incorporate disability"
then i gave examples at the end of each branch
Oh mine is much simpler and dumber
and then in the caption i would mention how, like from one source, certain approaches might be more "narrative prosthesis"
well the drawing itself probably doesnt need citing
thats the thing
I dare you to try and understand my overview

lmao
uh
course topic?
Uhhh
Cognitive Systems
i hope you explained your chart in the caption <:monkaS:442185930867081218>
mine is cyborg ecologies and im writing about trees :))
well its like this
Oh
My MCWP topicx
Is also Cyborg Ecologies
you wouldnt have a visual element that you CANT use in your paper
I saw the readings on mushrooms and things
And decided to double down on cogs
so if you can tie it to a topic in your paper, you can tie a source to the visual element in the caption
you have about 3 lines to work with for your caption
shorter the better for that tho
Yeah I have a 3 line caption
And I also take a couple of lines in the paper to set the scene
is "cognizer" a term you can cite?
Yup
And I do
In the uh
*background*
A HUGE part of this paper is the background
ye
984 words of background
In fact
about 4 pages <:yeet:442868651792793601>
well if yall want me to check your papers over, id be happy to, otherwise good luc
k
I'm in it for the P/NP really
lmao
Its the class I've kind of ignored for 8 weeks
i guess youre fine then
oof
how tho
mcwp50 is built with like, constant checkpoints
Spend an hour or two on the various checkpoints
i just want the A...
Easy enough
lol
As long as I get an A or A+ in my other 4 classes
oh right they probly dont mandate attendance this time huh
Its all good
Oh I went to every lecture anyway
I like my TA
He kul
huh
well thats not ignoring it then lmao
I never miss lecture
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
showing up was part of participation grade im p sure for my ta
and he required webcams on
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
Oh wow
Mine didn't
ah, im a little surprised they did that this time what with online and corona
We had two students that couldn't attend at all
Because of time differences
the muir writing department is a kinda bs smh

<@!268824350826692611>  gl w college apps~ if u ever need me for em esp common app i gotchu!!!
yes
jkdfjfasd;jkf ty
im sure ill be here panicking and asking for help a lot <:xd:612726759846051861>
common app was literally the death of me<:PEPESCREAM:466446495747670027>
mom says start in summer
so
soon
eek
I somehow killed the common apps
kinda scared ngl
yeah just like start thinking abt what u wanna write abt
are you gonna do early action apps
I can't write essays
maybe a couple
but I can write stories
^
ok i‚Äôm Jus Sayin
so I made really good common apps
my stories are a lot better than my essays
once I got them checked
:0
imagine
ur burnout is gonna be a lot earlier LOLOLOL
just write your stories
not writing your college apps
and then get
yeah
bc that‚Äôs what happened to me
3 days
before they're due
someone to professionally check it
jenny-
hoping i make one i want then i dont have to do the winter ones <:xd:612726759846051861>
ok but like
I didn't apply until the night before
im kinda scared cuz
so
i did a bunch of sumemr program apps
I also didn't SIR until the last hour
this past winter/spring
omg
like 9?
8?
something like that
2 got no response, i assume canceled or rejected
1 waitlist -> accepted
and the rest rejections xddd
be that
so now im kinda
worried
because
essay bad
you got 1 accepted and waitlist
:(
so thats really good
ye
a lot of people get none
after 20
yeah thats why i did so many
i was originally only applying for 2
aand then
it turned into 12
then i cut it to whatever i ended up doing
yee good mentality
always over apply
was the easiest one that i got into
ended up not doing it
cuz it was supposed to be like
lab work and lectures
but now its online
and $2500
for 2 weeks
so
oh lord
mom said not worth
yeah no
not at all
so now im just doing summer college classes yeehaw
doin some cs and bio
oo
thats really good prep
I was smol brain and lazy
so I never did that
lmao
parents leaerned from stoof
told me to tryhard earlier
MOOD
good idea
its like ah yes your brothers were great
but they could've done better
my parents didn't know anything about college
you need to be better
so ive been doing some summer classes every year
and summer program last summer
both my elder brothers went to community college
ah
and dropped out
so when they heard UCs
they were like whats that
oof
it took until the middle of last year aka sophmore year
for them to really understand college
Imagine doing common app lol
but my little brother is a little shitter and is barely completing adult school because he did really bad in HS
And yes I've been revived <@268824350826692611>
he's finally turning around
but it took him way too long
he's def not going to college he thinks its useless
oh damn
wb chris :)
I feel that, I'm scared of messing up, both my siblings went to ucs so me not going was going to be a death sentence
^
Good thing I got in <:pepecry:712987584976125952>
yeah my parents are like

good morning gamerz

that was yesterday :////
do you know people in the class that went diana <:PES_SadHug:622403182252916756>
yeeee
i got lucky bc he recorded it but at the same time it's like "when tf am i gonna actually watch it"
me for any lecture
good morning tritons
<a:ohohoho:636686946734964786>
tht's trash pandas to u
JKKFJDKJ
i saw that confessions post abt changing the mascot from king triton to sun god
raccoon mascot is valid
however i love our chad mascot too much
chAD MASCOT FSKJG
it would be pretty dope if we were known as ucsd sun gods
however
other schools wish their mascot could have washboard abs like king triton
i think sd beats all the other mascots in the uc system tbqh
like 3 schools have bears as their mascots
<a:aPES_Sleep:513527329738194954>
one has. A BANANA SLUG
AHAHAH ok i like the banana slug because at least it's kinda funny
it's p memey but compared to tritons OOF
anteater
<:peterS:699397578877435975>
also we have a cute handgesture
you mean the west side one?
jkjk
or the white power one?
even ucsf has a bear mascot liek WH AT
what even is our mascot, king triton? sun god? racoons? CS dungeon kids?
tht's the multifacetedness of ucsd: you canbe whatever the hell u wna be
http://www.isthisathingpodcast.com/mascotreviews/university-of-california-mascots-ranked
I heard king triton has an 8 pack. That king triton is shredded
this was a fun read
they are trying to get rid of the gaucho
be less racist or something
How is the anteater first place
Daddi oski is #1 in my heart <:uwudaddy:606017963308613636>
king triton looks funny
i wanted to take a picture with king triton this year at triton day but alas <a:pensivebear:523313966097891328>
king triton with his gigachad muscles should be #1
i actually thought the gaucho was kinda cool
my brother went there though so im a lil biased i guess
I think Tritons is actually the coolest mascot out of all of them, especially in name
Like cmon bro, it‚Äôs a Triton
*banana slug intensifies*
:3
Nah
LOOL
A slug can‚Äôt beat a literal god
/s

i have a question for everyone hehe
yo
what are your ~thoughts~ on height in a partner
no important at all
is that just bc like you don't care LOL
yeah lol
AND SORRY IM NOT TRYING TO SOUND RUDE i just wanted a diff perspective
no thats exactly it lol
I don't really care for it
i feel like ppl talk abt big height differences being cute but also like i think there's cute moments with any variation in height including no difference
mine's tall but idrc
but it's nice to stuff my face on his chest <:kirblush:613942747224604702>
> i feel like ppl talk abt big height differences being cute but also like i think there's cute moments with any variation in height including no difference
<@!245736329382461440> yes
shorter than u they can wear ur sweater. taller than u then u wear their sweaters. same height wear each other's sweaters
me agree
my most honest answer: if i date a guy and he's my height or above i don't mind. personally it's rlly nice to have someone taller so i can feel cute and be lil spoon more TBQH. if he's an inch shorter than me, than ok, i wouldn't rlly be attracted to any guy i have to look down at

idm girls of any height
> it's rlly nice to have someone taller so i can feel cute and be lil spoon more TBQH
felt that
> idm girls of any height

felt THAT
but nina we know thats not the case for me AHAHHA but nah nah idrc
sandy tol
<:pepesit:694447186879971401>
Snadu too tol
not too tol
cant have too tol
not too tol
but bumble match is same height
if the guy is discouraged by the fact tht i prefer ppl who are taller than me, i will not hold tht against him. i wouldn't want them to get with me in the first place bc there are other ppl who wouldn't judge em based on their height who would be more fit for them
and like literally all my life i was like " nu i need someone taller than me " so dis new for me
yeah tru
wear heels assert dominance
OK FA
X
2 inch soles
heels hort
imagine wearing heels
2 inch NAH NAH NAH
more
dont have to imagine
STILETTOS
everyone is taller than me so i do not mind any height
like imma be clear yes there r short kings but if it's a huge difference i just. wouldn't be interested
D A G G E R H E E L S
oh lordy lol
i think my tallest heels are like 3 1/2 or 4
> like imma be clear yes there r short kings but if it's a huge difference i just. wouldn't be interested
<@!286708165612011531> same
<:MonkaSnug:633819928062984192>
my highest heels are like 3 inches too
wait wat
yall the first test of my relationship was when i had to walk from pc to warren in heels and i called him to bring me some flippity flops bc i couldnt get farther than sac
it do be nice to make eye contact with someone my height tho. it's like "hahai don't gotta crane my neck to see u"

4" heels only make me 5'0

Fuck this evening was a billion heart attacks
So much was due
Tuesday is the next heart attack day thanks to MCWP and my other writing class
> chiming in to say that boi do i hate college writing
<@!662123516656877588> I second this
According to my own genetics professor's grade calculator, I need a minimum of 57% on the final to get an A- and that seems super not right
how well did you do in the rest of the class?
and how much weight does the final hold?
It's a bit complicated the grading scheme, but the final is either 30% or 15% and the rest being covered by the homework. For the rest of the grades, they're mainly 95%+
With a midterm score like that it's a bit suspicious.
it be like that sometimes
for my ceng class, he sent out matlab functions for us to calculate our grades
and if I just dont take the final I get an A
this isn't how I thought the end of the world would look like if im honest

you should get real ID automatically if you did it within the last 2 years

I have an A- rn and the final was made no-fault
<:sweat:713285695694831647>
in that case I feel as though ive you've been over studying and stressing you should tone it down and realize that you're at a good point and you should focus on what you know and really study that rather than trying to learn something new, because it can only make your grade better
if thats not the case and you're just stressing because its a final
that makes sense
and I have that a lot
I finished doing the practice exam <:sweat:713285695694831647>
Ngl the first half had me struggling
And ty for ur advice miggy <@!198581553834622977> <:pepeOK:490384227729408000>
npnp, did the second half feel easier or easy ?
Like ez clap
The second half was just derivations of the hw
if so focus on that, and grasp it then focus on the first half but dont throw all your resource into learning it but like casually practice it and if you get it you get it, if you don't you don't and if you have the motivation look into it later and actually learn it on your own time
rather than just throwing all of your energy in a burst
because then you will only learn it for a bit
good morning gamerzz

YES
yes*
we have discord lecture
our students begged him
he is a cs professor tho
prob a little more comfortable with exploring
hmmm
That‚Äôs kinda Pog
<a:pepeFAST:650248098483929108>
well our only other option
at my school
with licensing is webex
and mics cannot be adjusted on webex
so we really couldn't hear him
we could hear every single thing he clciked tho
(we also have zoom for my school, but ran out of licenses)
he could have used twitch or discord, but discord is so great
he answers dms and i feel a little bad bc it's not always during class days
he just sees s/t and responds, so communication is rly good
but yaaaa discord live lectures
<:bigbrain:650505958107119616>
Time to do that for my di/oh

Where did you get it <@!198581553834622977>
gweetar center
ooo
theres only in san marcos
theres one*
I used to go a lot as a kid
Online? :o
because we would get strings for my violin and my brothers guitar
there
oooo
we also went for my Drum set there
and yes Nathan online
ah yes going for violin string, i think the only reason i knew about guitar center was because every time something happened in our orchestra, my teacher would just tell us to go there and buy/fix it
yeah im honestly surprised its still alive
but I mean props to them
I want to learn badly since my ex played :(
I just had a random burst to learn an instrument
and guitar called to me
well I played guitar before to help my brother play songs
<:banzai:442185100273123328>
but I never actually learned it

I was going to go for a $400 one but it was sold out
üëÄ
$400 <:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>

i was playing a valorant and i was so dizzy that i was like did the game end yet? <:kek:490008924414803968>
I want to eventually record and I didn't want something that didn't sound crisp

my liver prob hates me
did you buy the battle pass btw, miggy?
yeah being drunk increases somethings by ruining other things
a long time ago lol
oo ok
I bought stuff in Beta
dom told me to buy it bc it was only $10
so I had 17k creds
but im like uh
ooo nice
if you're playing this much
$10 is worth
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
hmmm
idk im just trying not to spend any more money bc i just paid my credit card bill for my pc
and it kinda hurt my soul and bank account
I guess yeah thats a good way
but im dum
so I would still do it
ü§î

the tool they give
its really nice

becasue it pulls it out evenly
so no need to be scared
yeah i saw the tool
mmk
well if i ever find motivation
to actually
do it
xd
I did mine immediately
honestly you don't need the tool but it does make it better to use
because I like having custom keyboard
yuh your keyboard has very nice keycaps
if you're taking out a bunch you want the tool
hmm theres no arm rest though
hopefully
my wrists
cause it hurts your fingers
üëÄ
don't fuck themselves
üëÄ
if you use your keyboard sideways you dont need rest
sideways?
so sideways
yeah
but like
which side does in
right side goes towards you or left side goes towards you üëÄ
i think its right side goes towards you
ü§î
> right side goes towards you or left side goes towards you üëÄ
<@!446932571192819713> the age old question

<@!580246928596664321> thoughts on ben-ezra final
?
<:widethink:440237377664057353>
did u finish
Midterm easier than final
i didnt finish a part of a question
9b
I‚Äôll just leave it at that
u think theres gna be a curve
like
Idk
looking at my answers again i think worst case would prolly be a B
It depends on the averages
but idk if i did better or worse than avg
apparently the midterm avg was like 80%
and i was higher than avg but not enough to get curved to an a
Considering that we just finished the final the grades wont be out this quick
and idk how people p/np'ing will affect his decision to curve or not
i don't think giving like extra time on a final that was longer/harder than it should've been is a valid accomodation
considering prof um's class gets 24 hours
and i think someone said sth ab another 20e section having no-harm final
The exam wasnt made any harder or longer
i feel like the time pressure was worse than the mt
but idk if thats jus bc i was burnt out on math by the time 8am rolled around
Prob
For me i was able to finish the exam in one hour and thirty mintes
So i started just **checking bac and forth**
i took the full 4 and didnt finish lol
neither did my friends
so idk
KAJDKAKSKAKSJS
HI WICHAWD

my friend literally pnp'd during the final lmfao
<:xd:612726759846051861>

<:widethink:440237377664057353>

üôÇ
i mean ik some people finished but for me and everyone else i know
Lol
they didnt
ik someone got an extra hour
also im so fucking annoyed by people
**honest system amirite**
that text me
asking for helop
during finals
like
bro
im doing the same final
Same
stop
give them bad info
Like ik we‚Äôre on the same boat
But damn
like u got kicked out of workshop for not showing up
üòÑ
why r u asking for help rn
The exam is literally open notes
**look at textbook examples if u rly dont get it**
yea
i looked at notes pdf's
and hw
but i havent like rlly slept since like
the weekend?
so my brain was so fried for the final
Oof
haha xd
Yeah kinda same
I chugged coffee for once in a while
<:sweat:713285695694831647>
i lowkey lived off caffeine pills but past a certain point i dont rlly need
caffeine
like u know how during an allnighter ur tired 1-4am then after that
ur just good to go
for the rest of the day
Yeah
yea
After the exam i ate my lunch
like i napped on monday for a bit but i wasnt even tired for last nights allnighter
And head straight to bed
same haha
i jus woke up
at like
8pm
Got myself 8-9hr sleep
<:pepeOK:490384227729408000>
moooood
im jus scared that like
theres no more mathematically clueless ppl in 20e
like there was in 20a-c
to pad the curve
if that makes sense
Lol
so i could very well be
the dumbest person in the class
i am mathematically clueless in 20e
üôÇ
Ok ngl tho if u alr made it to 20e chances r you‚Äôre not that dumb
<:xd:612726759846051861>
u have 24 hours to be clueless :)
man
thats true üôÇ
im dumb as fuck
its just that
in test environments i can do kinda ok
Like u **survived thru that calculus**
like 20a i showed up late to the final without a cheatsheet bc i didnt realize

No if there was it'd be more noticeable
But I am blind
maybe its my phone
There's nothing wrong.
The phone's weird.
bc it isnt weird on my laptop
KEK
I know there‚Äôs like a glitch in some names
Where it looks like there‚Äôs a space
I have an actual space though.
My falling leaves are a bit off.

There‚Äôs a space
<@!198581553834622977>
pls help
My name always have trouble with the bot that deals with badges
?
no enough space
<:yeet:442868651792793601>
try it now
yay
ty
I took out unnecessary space
yall the past few days i felt like
Smthn was missing <:FeelsBadMan:441463646124507136>
and then it hit me that
My mom never returned my other blankie after washing it
And i normally always have at least 2 blankies
Has she stolen it for her own uses?
<:FeelsBadMan:441463646124507136>
no she put it away bc she said i was psychotic for using two winter blankets in the heat
<:peepocry:640363747990306827>
lmao
the blankies hide the sadness
my bed feels BARREN
is this wat loss is like
<:pepehands:464568955533524992>
Blankies help a lot with sadness. It's been my substitute for human interaction for years now <:kek:490008924414803968>
But now it's tearing apart <:pepehands:464568955533524992>
I think I need to buy a weighted blanket for sleep
No this is loss 
| ||
|| |_
thonk
<a:surprisekms:639732940263260190>
i dont use blanket for weight i use bc it soft
it where my limbs go
<:kirblush:613942747224604702>
n then my head go on plushies
pillows dont exist
this is super random but anyone who looks at sokka and says "i don't like him bc he doesn't have powers" is an actual weiner
anyway
carry on
*hides my twelve pillows*
He's smart.
Bbut Sokka is a weiner
And a weiner.
XD
the more i look at it the more i want my desk
<:peepocry:640363747990306827>
it wont look aesthetically pleasing but itd be so efficient
<:pepehands:464568955533524992>
id actually never have to get out of bed again
Other than to pee
sokka is a frat bro at heart but im glad he got the misogyny slapped out of him
he is now frat boi with heart of gold
frat guys scare me bc they come in packs
THEY DO
Anyone who comes in packs scare me
what abt. puppers
Im wildly afraid of middle schoolers
puppers r ok
humans in packs r not
omg do u know tht one mulaney joke
where he's like
yo middle schoolers come in sets of like 20 and it makes me genuinely terrified
like i could fight one of them but 20????
if i see a grp of 13 yr olds on the other end of the sidewalk i will cross the street bc i do not want to cross a bunch of middle schoolers
middle schoolers r the meanest ppl in the world
they havent developed a sense of empathy
but they know mean shit
<:pepehands:464568955533524992>
him: they'll make fun of me and say sth like "LOOK AT THAT MAN he's got F EM I N IN E hips!" and i'll go STOOOOP I'M THE MOST INSECURE ABOUT THAAAAT
oh indeed they do
tiny little monsters
Indeed
pre teens in packs
<a:hahakek:676470025317777484>
if i see more than two middle schoolers approach me i will cry
high schoolers r not as bad bc they learn empathy
but they also travel in packs
So they r also not ok
but only like juniors n seniors r ok
sophomores r kinda arrogant ngl...... like idk y....
i think
people are scary in general
üôÇ
freshmen r just middle schoolers w more power
<:pepehands:464568955533524992>
tru
^ case proven
right there
ik bc i was a freshman and i was an asshole
same
o
lmao
LMAOO
wait im still an asshole
Freshman yr me deadass physically kicked a few seniors when the teacher wasnt looking <:pepeOK:490384227729408000>
makes sense
the tiny people usually the worst
<:kek:490008924414803968>
its just a big child
they were being annoying n purposefully blocking me
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
so i went *ANGOR*
i still do not have empathy but like at least i understand social norms slightly now
<:kek:490008924414803968>
i am still a ball of angor
but now i am a silent ball of angor
lowkey middle school me only collected plushies to use as projectiles for when someone tried to enter the room and wake me up
_wake me up_
WAKE ME UP INSIDE
CANT WAKE UP <:cryangry:606031757099401217>

I have one no fault final with a secured A, I should be able to sleep right ? Cause less stress but I just can‚Äôt find it in myself to be able to sleep the past 2 days REEE
Same for me but I have something to actually worry about and my motivation has never been lower.
I hate sleep
Like why can‚Äôt I just fucking go into bed and sleep like a fucking normal person
i feel that
<:pain:713285895419330591>
I didn't get any sleep yesterday night
and im having so much trouble rn
so like yay sleepless nights
at least this has made me want to clean out my subscription list on youtube
crazy to see how much effort someone put into creating their channel and then also how fast they disappeared and you forget about them
the internet is scary
i havent been able to fall asleep yet and my dad just woke up to go to work
<:WRONGHOLE:713286884972953662>
:(
bro I legit saw the sun go up and down twice
:(((
it aint healthy but Ive been trying to fix but the stress anf angor from that I think makes it worse
i feel you
<:pepehands:464568955533524992>
i've been watching this harvard psychiatrist  who stream on twitch
and he made a valid point that I think probably is affecting me
I think too much and have too many unresolved things I think about subconsciously
that keep me up
when I try to sleep
and i need to meditate and do this exercise to complete those un-completed thoughts
quite understandable bc it's one of the only times youre left with your thoughts
so that I can relieve myself of the internal anxiety and stress I have
but its hord
<:PepeHands:504520804466163732>
i rooting for you miggy
also our generation has skyrocketed mental health to an all time high
we now have more patients with mental health issues than people with cancer and many other prominent illnesses
its crazy
oh boy
most of the patients are people in college :) or in our age range
ig in a way thats good but also having mental health issues might just become a trend that people exploit :(((
hopefully not a lot
but it also means that there's more people that we can relate to and find comfort in
yeah this quarantine isnt helping me at all but I went with Christine and two other friends to eat today
and I felt so relieved and happy
yay!!!
very nice very nice
I am starved of human contact and the feeling of love that it's made me such a depressed little shitter who only complains and is sad
maybe thats a little harsh to say about myself
but its true
:(((
being by myself leads me to think not so bueno thoughts
hopefully summer will treat you better
maybe, I got summer classes so thatll keep me busy hopefully but tbh I said that about this qtr and it did not work
im just hoping once my guitar arrives it helps me destress
ooooooo
also didn't mean to drop all this on you Dino but I just thought I had to get it out or else it would drive me nuts, thanks for listening <3
it's np! dw about it!!
is it weird that sometirms
i am hear to listen
also dont feel obligated to answer
I forget mental health exists
tes
yes
das bad
oop
oH
imo
i do too
ok its not jsut me LMAOO
you get too engrossed in something else to care about yourself
me
me
100% me
or like something stresses you out so much that you dont care about the stress just about getting it done
@ me today with my final
life hard
it is
too many things to care about
yes
I be cri right now because im like I need to start caring about myself more but its hord when all my life i've been the rock that everyone has gone to and looked to for comfort and support
but I feel so broken down
but I know I can't help everyone all the time
and thats whats making me stressed
that I know I can't but I still do it anyways
wait hold on i saw a tik tok about this
let me find it
omg diana LMAOOO mood
But yuh i get u miggy
sometimes u jus gotta
not care abt other ppl
well I wouldn't say that
but def put yourself as prio
like ill just nap or watch shit and not look at my phone for like 4 hrs at a time
cw: dark imagery
https://vm.tiktok.com/oVuqa6/
you see I would Wendy
but I get sad when I have no one to talk to
o idk then
My natural state is alone preferably asleep
my life is a mess
ahh but you see sleep is hord
or else I would sleep too
sleep v hard
sleep either super ez or super hard
No in between
uh
When i used to not sleep wat id do to rest is just lay there w eyes closed
sleep has only been super hard for the past year
It dorsnt help u falla sleep imo
but it like
the reason why im awake is bc ive been on tik tok for the past two hours
Made me feel like more rested
also dino that is def how Im feeling
and i missed my sleep window
ty for sharing
yeeee
npnp
I mean alone time doesnt needa come from sleep
U can be alone but w someone
i felt slightly attacked when the algorithm showed it to me
Like camming while watching shit
I wanna be in calls with people but most people I vibe with are super busy with finals and other stuff
and I value their success more than my emotions so I do not pester
although many people say its not a big deal when it comes to wanting to help
I still can't take it upon myself to take peoples time
from studying
im in calls all the time <:kek:490008924414803968> if ur stupid as shit and rely on OH to fix ur code then ull be on call 6 hrs a day trust
<:kek:490008924414803968>
I mean
but thats not the calls I need
If ur all camming but doing ur own stuff
u wouldnt be taking time away
its like studying together in cv
i kinda know how you feel miggy bc i am very much a group studier aka my best studying is done in group settings
yall spend time tgthr but still productive
so i compromised by camping vc
mm I see
people are still there to hang out and bond over the music
i study best alone at 4am bc thats when my brain turns on
ngl the only person who joins me in VC is Randy, bless that man
randy op
caitlin and alex say im only big brained in my sleep or at 4am
so I get sad
when no one joins
and so I tend to not do it as much
when r ur vcs
i haven't done it in a while
i go to OHs til like 7 normally and then sometimes there 9-10:30 OH
but I used to do it from like 6-11pm most of the time
but then ik the ta so we fuck around until 2am
just imo music is a lot easier to do bc it doesnt require talking and people can just jam and share their favs
no thats what it is
i'll hop into conrad
but im sure once summer starts up people will have more time
and queue some music
did it for like 2 weeks straight and Randy and maybe charles were the ones who joined
sometimes jenny for like a sec
aight miggy i gotchu next time
im just trying to be open with my feelings rn
idk im pretty sure a few ppl on discord prefer studying in groups so maybe u cna hold a discord study thing and yall can zoom n see each other
so that they dont cloud up my mind
itll be cute
n hopefully productive
I try but people have their own groups
already
so its hard to make something happen
like study groups?
Im sure theres some ppl who r just chilling w/o a study group
most likely but i've tried a couple times none really successful
its just hard when you study different things
<:peepocry:640363747990306827>
<:thonk:440231969796784128>
Meanwhile I'm doing a drug deal
cool
A wild fongers has appeared
MY DAD IS ACTUALLY LEAVING FOR WORK RN
yeah
WTF
when I was at home
I would see my dad leave for work at 4am too
he kind of just says hi now
instead of telling me to go to sleep
because he knows
big facts
i hide
My mom sees me up at 6am and doesnt question whether i slept or not anymore
mostly bc she sees me passed out at 9pm for my daily napnap
idk I just haven't found my group yet
i think
im going to take it as my queue to try to sleep <:peepocry:640363747990306827>
okie gn dino <3
gn!!
i'll come back in a couple of hours
wishing you the best
wishing you the best
i'll prob still be here
tbh
gn!!!
do u have any friends in the classes ur taking rn who‚Äôd be down to study n chill
I mean yall dont rly needa be studying the same thing imo
I haven't found anyone i've connected with
But idk bc i dont call ppl to study
people are very different
in my major
i msg caitlin n alex at most but thats abt it
o
Wym different
like their interests, hobbies, how they study, how we conversate, I haven't found anyone in my major that I vibe with and can talk to
like dont get me wrong i've made friends because some of us end up taking the same classes
but we only vibe in class
o i get u
me in hs KEK
yeah
so I just haven't found my group
and i've been trying
the group I had
graduated
and all live out of state or are working somewhere else
yea study groups r hard to find bc its typically a quarterly thing
so they don't have the time anymore
hnless yall need smae classes
or have similar schedules for multiple qtrs in general
I also find it hard
to
conversate with people
without constantly
hanging out with them
for example, I try and keep conversations with Yen now but I feel like sometimes im trying to find things to say
and nothing comes naturally
and thats because I strive on experiences and finding out how people feel by seeing how they react and carry themselves in person
but with quarantine
I have no idea
because text
doesn't really
amplify anything
ima be honest i just dont rly msg ppl so idk how to help w that LMAOO
its okay
im not asking for help
I just spew things
to get them off my mind
just know when I ask for help, I will say it
but i mean tbh if u wana converse but duno how to get it going id say jus shoot ur shot
send a meme or some shit
thats wat i do
I used to be really good at it in middle school
now idk I just kinda lost it all
i feel like a lot of ppl r a lot better socially in middle school lmaoo
i used to be rly good w fast paced group environments
well yeah you gave less of a shit
about anything
now i get tired afte rhanging out for like 20 mins
now you're too fucking warry of everything you do
well at least I think I am
I hate that I know all these things about myself
and I know I can fix them
but I don't
and I try to but fail
and keep trying
some things fix w time
Its ok to let it fix itself slowly
like idk ig the best example i can think of is maturity
like u can know that ur immature but
U cant just fix it just bc u want to
u jus gotta grow w timeeee
n das okkk
yeah im just a hypocrite because I tell that to people all the time
that things go slow
and it takes time
but its just hard to put it to practice for yourself
because you're your own biggest critic
I know the solution to my problem is literally like you said to just stop giving a shit
yea it can be frustrating when u arent changing as fast as ud like
but when thats all you've done for the past 10years of your life
its hard to shake off
compare urself to where u originally started and not where u wana be
that might help
bc ull notice changes
n ull focus on how uve changed as opposed to what u need to change
possibly
I don't really know where I started so its hard to do that but I've def given that some tthought here and there
never a considerable amount
but I have
if u duno where u started just choose a random earlier time KEK
bc it probably means its smthn thst happens as u grow
Like 13 yr old u vs u now
when i duno i typically choose preteen yrs bc i feel like preteen vs now is when u can see the most growth bc its like ur lowest pt LMAOO
i've actually gotten worse from when I was 13 to now
i was living life
at 13
o well i was yikies at 13 so
now im depressed and an insomniac
oop
that was like 14 yo me
<:kek:490008924414803968>
but i mean
Ig just estimate a time
where u started to care and try to fix it
and then how u r rn
> where u started to care and try to fix it
<@!262847360403636224>  pls explain, by fix you mean ?
actually hold on to that thought
go finish your hw and studying for your final
I know you have a lot on your plate
like ig just start making an effort towards addressing it
i mean
I have two no risk finals i didnt study for
But im alrdy at an A- for both classes
My main concern rn  is 140L but i cant do anything til OH bc im super stuck on the code
and OH is at 9
might nap til then
good idea
my brain is exhausted
from all the emotions
maybe itll help u nap
<:feelsweirdman:608930224318447617>
when im mentally tired i jus nap for like 4 hrs
key word "i'm"
you
I can't do that
maybe jus lay in bed n close eyes to help u feel rested at least if u cant sleep
I did that earlier
it helped me get energy back when i used to not sleep
o
miguel I FEEEEEEL U
thats why im up
rn
my guy
<:scrunchthink:440232169919610880>
I‚Äôm sleepless and fucking sad af

that professor is a blessing and a demon
i said yesssssssssssss
lmao I wouldve said the same
with no hesitation
ya he was also asking
if anyone else i am taking is doing no fault

most
and that was good enough for him

do i give up on a final
and just do p/np
wats ur grade in the class
~~yes~~
uh so it works by a point system
currently i have 75 points
I feel like a lot of people are doing that right now jeff
i need to get 5 points on a final to get a B
B-
How many points is it worth
^
fianl i think is total 35 points
i mean can you cheese 5 points on it?
yes
pnp
when your prof has to give you a pep talkk
be free
so realistically i only need 15 points to get an A-
oh wait
waitgo for it
15 points ez
so ur telling me
you only need a 50% to get an a-?
you got it
just take it
u need an F to get an A-
bruh
less than 50% actually
just do it
and then count the points you know you got
<:kek:490008924414803968> **you need an F to get an A-**
but this test uses so much brain power
my final is 15 points and i need all of them to get an A- <:pepehands:464568955533524992>
and decide a grading based on that
you're not using your brain for anything else anyway üôä
you only need so much brain power to get an F
üëÄ
I mean if we only use 10% of our brain at all times
can provide loaner brain I dont need mine till fall
rates vary
you only need 4% of it to get an A
can i borrow your brain
i have
the 10% rule is BS
uh
nothing
<:kek:490008924414803968>
low low price of
to offer
well shit
wait wait
i can
wheres my valorant boosts
i will stream 1 valorant game for you <:kek:490008924414803968>

<:kek:490008924414803968>

i can not turn in my final essay and be fine

<:pepehands:464568955533524992>
its okay 105 is where it gets fun
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
why is 105 just ass class in all depts
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
whats 105 in aero eng
wait no 105 is actually pretty interesting
i enjoyed it
**fluids**
jk idk
105 in mae is math TWO
they took math
<:thonk:440231969796784128>
and they made everything infinite
and doubled it??
and I cried
oh
inf^inf?
nah but basically its
PDEs
and fourier shit
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
105 is taking heat and spreading it across an infinitely llong thin pole
or tube lol
then calculating the heat as it spreads
105 told me that basically everything is infinite and nothing matters, least of all my grade
practically
ohhh want to carry me in my fourier analysis class
woah woah woah
ANALYSIS
i feel like half my class is about to switch to p/np and just give up on the final since everyone has 100% on hw and matlab
foruier transforms are soo hard
slow your roll there cowboy
I just know what they are
never said I knew WHY they are
damn thats a mood tomer

triton weak af as well
only people that can are kages sun bot and whoever <@&642811673945833522> is
give it to me
i can't
i don't have enough power to give you more power than i have
sun god bot has power?
we can make that happen then
yea
but i rather give the power to moon god
<@!433774411682938890> can we give moon god the same power as sun god?
but wai
so moon god can snap me

i did this for lab3 too
F
im p gud at debugging via waveform now
but lab3 only took 3 hrs so
we do that too but lke
i dont think ours look as crazy

its like you meet
500 new people
ahh gotta love the orientation friends
and week 0 friends
mhm
there for a second gone the next
imagine being allowed outside the house
don't forget
class friends
quarter friends
I made a couple in my freshman year engineering classes
mhm
2 of the three of us dropped engineering lol
i ended up really clicking with one of my friends from one of my classes
and since we're both cs
we ended up being in a lot of classes together
and they were really good friends with their roommates so i just became the 4th roommate
üôÇ
Lol nice nice
are you going to move back on campus next year if oyu can?
maybe i did a lot of stupid shit during middle school lol
i peaked in hs lets gooooo
i peaked when i was born
it be downhill since then
i never hit my peak, i hit a plateu somewhere early on
uh prob not moving back to campus
fall quarter, for sure not going back
if i need to come back, i might get an off campus with some friends or jsut commute
damn that sux lol
my life sucks
My life blows
i was about to make that joke
Ur mum made u
The biggest joke
i think i peaked in 5th grade bc i rmbr extremely enjoying life and school when i was like 10
also lots of reading
^
My life is in a false vacuum state
tfw i read one book a day from 4th grade to 6th grade
"omg i'm peaking"
when i was a kid i wanted to travel the world and as a 20 year old i play geoguessr instead üíØ
I peaked towards the end of my career in a place all the time
I think i am at stable rock bottom
hey richard thats traveling in a sense
But it sinks deeper and everything goes to shit
i think i rock bottom'd spring qtr of freshman yr and mentally/academically its been up from there
like no matter what happens it is literally impossible for me to be in a worse place than freshman year
even considering remote learning
like !!!! imagine being constantly happy for an entire yr-- tht was 5th grade
that was me like
jr yr hs
when i felt confident ab my future
My life plateaued 2 inches above rock bottom and has been there for 2 years
I have lost the ability to feel
on the bright side once u hit rock bottom u can only do better and better
u kno?
False vacuum state
I think im on the up swing right now?
lowkey dunno wht a vaccuum st8 is
electroswing, rands?

||b00bz||
U think ur at the bottom but ur not
i think rockbttming is sth tht feels worse reminiscing on, in my experience
i think a lot of it is realizing u cannot be worse off than u were
I love electroswing ninob
tits
blue tits
saggy tits
I would love a pair of tits
like when u look back and yr like holy shit i was a horrible human being
oh i didnt need to censor then
I tend to do that
i am a terrible being
I am terrible
that was junior yr, nina was a toxic lil gremlin
but its not looking back, its realizing im kinda a shitty person right now
ooooo yess tht too
junior yr nina wasnt bad
elementary and middle school me was mute <:sad_dab:613867302701760542>
at least not to meeeeee
and high school me was annoying
I was an incel in freshman hs but thats over with now
Kekw
and now i'm depressed
I'm still thinking im kind of a chameleon outside of the internet
thanks dino, she was p bad tho, and not the good kinda bad
Who what where when why did UCSD change summer session to in person
<a:PEPESCREAM:659115134089822288>
?
wtf
wait what?
no fuckin way
no?
Everything i'm looking at is in person now
<a:PEPESCREAM:659115134089822288>
why would they change it all of a sudden?
üß¢
> but its not looking back, its realizing im kinda a shitty person right now
<@!213151486434082817> 
thank god ur self-aware, tht's the first step to change
They sure as hell didn't tell me my two classes were in person
<:cursecat:612044490307272727>
They changed since I looked a week ago
One of my fall classes went in person too
it still says all classes will be remote
<:gun2:607557159768686592>
I know

webreg says
irl
but im pretty sure
^
its still gna be online
all my classes are remote, but i aint tryna live at home for the rest of the yera
They changed today
Or a few days ago
I'm gonna advising
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
i think ppl have to deal with their faults and realize them in order to get a headstart in personal growth; the worst is when ppl point them out to me and i'm like, ignorant of my faults. which is needed sometimes but still sux  jdfjkdhgjdhgdfjlgdhfjlg

yea relax
I was shook because they removed the online disclaimer and added all in person classes
I think i need someone to beat the shit out of me, to help with my faults lol
<:cursecat:612044490307272727> I'm dropping my fall class though
sam
what the FUCK mine r inperson now
r u doing cse20 / cse12/15l
?
esp cse12 in fall
summer session?
im trynna find ppl
for tht
CSE 12 and 15 in the fall yes
lets gooo
staff?
Gary and Gary
<a:ohohoho:636686946734964786>
I believe
<:gary:433451558676594688>
<:monkaCHRIST:471374707531317248>
> I was shook because they removed the online disclaimer and added all in person classes
<@181482518107783168> im peeved idk if these were predetermined locations b4 covid but
jk gary made 15l final multiple choice this quarter
gary is for the kids

ripp
also
isnt it the same content anyways
cuz ik for 11 niema and the other prof
They could have avoided a heart attack by not changing them to the in person locations
had the same content
Gary wrote it so yes
yeah probably
yea sam lets grind this fall
<a:PepePopcorn:554328145344462848>
i thought it's always been in their in person locations
Wait they are gonna make the professors record it in person aren't they
for summer session
im prolly gonna be mainly prioritizing cse classes bc i feel like its more worth for this
In case people *want* to go
bc i feel like i wont do well in certain other classes no matter what
meanwhile
and some classes r ez
> i thought it's always been in their in person locations
<@!405810391025713156> Not when a little while ago monkas
It changed back so I died
i coudlve sworn
rclas was a fall enrollment thing
and it always had classrooms
?
rclas is for fall
yea
exactky
nah sam i saw rclas for both ss
my schedule is still online for falllllll
ur not tripping
^
rip the mulah
like which class
The classroom listing have all changed too
At least compared to when I enrolled
I guess its just whatever
Its sitll online
yea
i feel like in a dream world where zoom doesnt drop me from sessions all the time
and lectures are like live twitch streams where u can pause / skip to live
online wouldnt be that bad
like idk why u cant rewind zoom ...
> like idk why u cant rewind zoom ...
<@!595010202613317632> This is why professors should set them up as Zoom semianrs
yea
i feel like the idea of a "zoom meeting" doesnt make sense
when its one person talking to 400
Zoom Seminars are literally a thing too
Or at least they were
~~tfw you know you have no impulse control so you shouldn't crave alc so much bc you don't ever want to blackout or grow a dependency but mmm spicy water yummy and makes me less of me for a few hrs~~
Fun fact: Addiction and/or dependency has a genetic risk factor :)
:)))))))))
isn't it funny how my mom jokingly offered me alc and it was my dad that said no she's gonna be an alcoholic
~~and he's the alcoholic of the fam~~
i mean what
> Fun fact: Addiction and/or dependency has a genetic risk factor :)
<@!186011132325003264> thank u neuro major hmmm my mom can't handle alc and my dad isn't a big alc person unless it's a fam reunion
What's a father figure? <:hyperstears:713286532441833492>
aha!
haha
discord zoom event: grp therapy and aa meeting
except we're all alcoholics and it's not anonymous
howEVER
i need therapy
i think i have a proclivity to get hooked on things easily
therefore
i should not indulge in drinking as much as i want to
My biological father is a bit of an alcoholic and the male person who lives in the house now makes it not ideal to go anywhere downstairs starting at 7PM.
therefore
<a:kyokothumbsup:593493208382832641>
no rushing, *ever*
haha! gotta love abusive households
/s
It builds character.
i used to think i was at an acceptable level of alcoholism but over the past qtr my friends living across the square in argo sent enough "one year ago today" snaps to b a yikes
when we get back were going to do exactly that dion
me: *trying not to turn this into trauma porn
also me: i have inherited so many horrible things and i would like to d*e
dino and nina
yes
I miss the magical first year moments living in Revelle. There was never a dull night.
no questions
wait thats a thing
revelle was gr8
trauma ... porn?
Atlantis representing <:hypers:471374617337135134>
oh wait revelle was very interesting for me
> It builds character.
<@!186011132325003264> i wish i didn't have to build a personality off of being abused, tho, that would've been nice
argo terra lounge >>
mmmm
> trauma ... porn?
<@!493178993814798346> yeah like, for example when ppl rt traumatic or graphic content and go OMG... this is so sad.. thots n prayers
OOH
ohhhhhhh
and like argo hall, was like the home of goon shit in revelle
or when ppl like, are like, "well MY childhood was more fucked up than YOURS"
at least for my year
like some kind of trauma olympics
Ooh i see
stewart hall ftwwwww
douglas can suck my ass
fuck douglas
and its powdery ass ceiling
you mean the asbestos ceilings?
5am alarms????? every week?????????
argo > blake i will rep argo & terra lounge forever
There's a certain peculiar solace in just openly talking about it with people who *gets* it and making it a trauma olympics sometimes. If it's in good taste, which it seldom is.
Douglas is the sad part of Warren.
revelle was nice
Revelle is where the party's at. Remember that clipboard at the top of the Keeling Apartments? I miss that little thing.
> There's a certain peculiar solace in just openly talking about it with people who *gets* it and making it a trauma olympics sometimes. If it's in good taste, which it seldom is.
<@!186011132325003264> i understand but it makes me pissed off when it becomes tellingly performative
i never lived in keeling :((
I believe theres a certain time and place for them,
i never lived in keeling either
keeling rooftop is so fkn nice
keeling is soo nice
but then again, we r all performers, pot calling kettle blk, yada yada
i spent some time there over ss2 2019
but i've been passed out in keeling
kinda cold though
the worlds a stage
oo i once did an impromptu on tht
whats an impromtu?
Sometimes I would go to the 10th floor and out the staircase overlooking Revelle and just sit there undisturbed.
wait were you a theater kid nina?
No one ever goes there and you make lots of friends with random birds.
I did that with the keeling garden
extempt speech kids r fuckin scary nina pls tell me u didnt do that
The apartment building closest to the parking lot is nasty though. The staircase there has a worrying amount of dead bees.
Walking around rimac forest was also super calming
there was one thing i hoped to never be in my life and that's a theater kid
i am my own one-woman disaster impromptu show
OOH i see
it was for decathlon
I was a drama kid, but a techie never an actor
ooh
actually I was an actor once for a very small part
we get to choose from 3 topics during speech comp, have a minute to deliberate what to say, and then answer it in 1:30 to 2 minutes
along with a prepared 3:30 to 4 min speech
I realized then that drama kids were as ||horny or hornier|| than band kids
> extemp speech kids r fuckin scary nina pls tell me u didnt do that
<@!595010202613317632> que es extemp

~~It's not sex it's ERP~~
<@!286708165612011531> u get given a topic w zero prep, u prep a speech on the spot, u pop off on tht topic
it was part of the show you right
terrified of anyone who can pop off on any topic at 5 mins' notice esp. when debate kids spent like ... 1-2 months on each resolution
im done... like actually done
it wasn't as extreme as tht but yes, along tht vein
we weren't supposed to use props but one girl came in yoga clothes and her yoga mat
for her prepped speech i assumed
which would dock her attire and general pts but who cares that was 5 years ago holy SHIT im old
sometimes i think ab like the terror of fucking up during a debate round and how little it matters 3 yrs later
hs seems so long ago
times were simpler
simp this simp that jus take me back to SIMPler times

im trying to write something in <#656357040406396958> but i cant articulate it and its frustrating
It's okay to not be able to articulate things sometimes
Much of what makes life wonderful and horrible is impossible to perfectly put into words
i usually dont have this problem so its frustrating
im going to try to autopilot it
If you really can't get it out, try posting one sentence at a time.
have you tried articulating
thanks
you're welcome

Anyone know how to wire computers?
wire??
he means like assemble it
theres a lot of good youtube videos that tell you how to do it, wilson
they'll be like, "this wire that looks like this, goes into this"
then you do that about 10 times and pray it works
